/**
 * Boundary guard. Two rails, both about which layer may depend on which, both broker-free.
 *
 * 1. Nothing under `packages/core/src/**` may import `@cotal-ai/workspace`. `@cotal-ai/core` is the
 *    wire standard; the machine-local workstation layer (`@cotal-ai/workspace`) depends on core,
 *    never the reverse. A core→workspace import would re-fuse the two faces this split exists to
 *    separate — and introduce a dependency cycle.
 *
 * 2. No shipped file may import `@cotal-ai/smoke-kit` — every `src/**` tree in the workspace, plus
 *    the two top-level entry points of the published `cotal-ai` package, which has no `src` tree of
 *    its own. The kit is test-only and private, so it is never published: a shipped file importing
 *    it would compile here and be missing at install time. That is the kind of break that shows up
 *    at a customer rather than in CI, which is why the rail is enforced here instead of written
 *    down and hoped for.
 *
 * 3. `@cotal-ai/smoke-kit` stays private and declares no dependencies. That second half is not
 *    tidiness: `private: true` on its own exempts nothing from the release train — changesets bumps
 *    dependents, so a private package that declares a first-party dependency is versioned like any
 *    other. Zero dependencies is what actually keeps it out, so it is a rail rather than a habit.
 *
 * Keeps both boundaries honest, not decorative. Runs in the `check` gate and CI.
 * Run: pnpm smoke:core-boundary
