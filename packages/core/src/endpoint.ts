   *
   * A throwing `close()` is not hypothetical: nats.js `NatsConnectionImpl.close()` awaits the

   * that reject leaves the underlying TCP transport ESTABLISHED even though every client handle

   * failed attempt). The recovery path is layered, from most graceful to most surgical, matching
   * nats-core's public surface (nats.d.ts: `close`, `drain`, `isClosed`; protocol.d.ts owns the
   * `transport` handle whose `close(err?)` is the socket teardown; transport.d.ts exposes a

   * (`nc.protocol.transport`) when the public API has already refused, and the ORIGINAL bind
   * error is re-raised at every layer. The close error is diagnostic noise. The bind error is
   * what the caller must see.
   *
   * The delivery-serve subs and `this.subs` array are handles created by a successful
   * `armDeliveryControl` on a PREVIOUS epoch; a bind failure on the retry never rewrites them
   * because arming is a late step. Left in place they point at a dead protocol and survive into
   * the next retry. The reviewer flagged this as an untested handle class. Zero them here so a

   * consumer takes a SET of filter subjects. The dashboard's activity feed used to answer this by
   * calling {@link channelHistory} once per channel and merging: each of those is a widening probe
   * loop, so the cost carried two multipliers (a probe loop per channel, and a fan-out across every
   * channel). Counted on the wire over a seeded corpus of 69 chat channels and 24 event channels at
   * limit 200: 2524 broker requests and about 8.0 MB transferred to return a 143,401-byte page,
   * against 143 requests and about 0.91 MB here. With no link cost the counts and the page size
   * repeat exactly across runs; the byte totals move by tens of bytes. `pnpm smoke:web-activity-read-cost` reproduces the
   * second column and a frozen copy of the fan-out shape; the first is that same suite run against
   * `544a974b7` (Cotal #1210).
   *
   * **The broker does the filtering, so the wire carries only what is asked for.** A channel left
   * out of `channels` costs nothing: its messages are never delivered, so a space whose volume is
   * dominated by channels the caller does not want stays cheap. That is the same "filter before the
   * fetch" property the per-channel fan-out had, kept rather than traded away.
   *
   * **The channel comes from the SUBJECT, never from the payload.** A message claims a `channel`
   * field, and this method ignores it: the tag is derived from the subject the broker routed the
   * message on, the same derivation {@link listChannels} uses to name a channel in the first place.
   *
   * **Concrete channels only.** Filter subjects on one consumer may not overlap, and a wildcard
   * channel subsumes its own subtree, so a wildcard here is refused rather than silently dropped or
   * silently double-counted.
   *
   * **Observer/admin credentials only, and the broker is what says so.** A multi-filter create
   * cannot encode its filter in the API subject, so it rides the bare
   * `$JS.API.CONSUMER.CREATE.<CHAT>` row that only the read-only dashboard profiles hold. An agent
   * credential pins the filter into the subject per channel and is denied here by the broker, which
   * is the correct answer: this method reads across channels, and an agent's read ACL is per
   * channel.

   *  **Why this exists when `channelHistory` already works:** authorization. A consumer pins its

   *  **The caller never names itself.** The daemon takes the principal from the broker-authenticated
   *  request subject ({@link serveControl} fail-closes when the payload `from` disagrees), so there is
   *  no caller-supplied identity to forge.
   *
   *  A channel outside the caller's read ACL THROWS. It must never come back as an empty page: "you
   *  may not read this" and "there is nothing here" are different answers and only one is safe to
   *  render as an empty conversation.

      // missed the dashboard's 8000ms deadline with nothing else on the connection (Cotal #1210).
      // That cost does not keep growing with the backlog, and saying it did was wrong: the old first
      // span was `max(limit * 4, 64)`, so at limit 500 it is 2000 messages, and ANY backlog of 2000
      // or more drains the same 2000-message window. The point is that the window, not the backlog,
      // sets the cost, and four pages to return one is already past the deadline on this link for
      // every such deployment. One page wide makes the

 *  the broker said "authentication expired" or because the cred is LOCALLY PROVABLY expired (its own
 *  JWT `exp` is past). The local check is decided without a round-trip, so a slow or failed connect
 *  never downgrades a dead cred to `unreachable`; the repair is `doctor auth` either way, never a
 *  registry prune (the D5 credential-death event). `unreachable` means nothing usable answered and
 *  the cred is not provably dead (refused / timeout / a stale registry entry). */

 *
 *  A presented cred that is PROVABLY expired by its own JWT is stale-auth (credential death) — and
 *  that is knowable LOCALLY, without the network, so it is decided FIRST, before the error type. On
 *  the wire the broker's rejection and the socket close race: a slow CI/Windows handshake can
 *  surface a bare transport failure (→ "unreachable") instead of a clean AuthorizationError, which
 *  used to misclassify a dead cred. Reading the cred removes that timing dependency entirely, so the
 *  classification is deterministic. Unreadable content falls through to the wire truth (no false
 *  stale diagnosis from garbage). `e` is undefined when the gate refused before any connect. */
