/**
 * The three outcomes required by #1648, each asserted on a real custodian process.
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG. A full smoke shard left about eighteen `custodian.js` processes behind per run,
 * each with parent pid 1 and roughly 65 MB resident. Ninety-one were resident at once on one host,
 * about 6 GB, with swap fully used. None of them exited on their own, nothing reaped them, and they
 * could not even be FOUND without walking `/proc/*\/cwd`, because the only thing tying a custodian
 * to its worktree was its cwd.
 *
 * WHY THE EXISTING SEAT SUITES STAYED GREEN THROUGH ALL OF IT. Every lifecycle cell ends by killing
 * the seat it launched, so the thing they measure is what a custodian does when someone is still
 * there to ask. The orphan is the opposite case: nobody is left, and no assertion in this package
 * looked at it. `lifecycle` now covers the unauthenticated-peer settle, which is one entry into that
 * state; the three cells here cover what the issue actually required.
 *
 *   O1  a custodian whose controller is gone exits on its own within a bounded time, and stops its
 *       child rather than leaving a blocked orphan in place of a resident one
 *   O2  an ordinary detach-and-re-adopt does NOT trip that bound: the window restarts at each
 *       disconnect, so a manager restart keeps its seats
 *   O3  a census is cheap: the run marker is on argv AND in the environment, and reads back
 *
 * O1 IS TIMED AGAINST A SHORT BOUND, NOT THE TEN-MINUTE DEFAULT, via `COTAL_SEAT_UNATTENDED_MS`.
 * That the default is ten minutes is asserted separately from the constant, so a suite that passes
 * on a short bound cannot imply the shipped one is anything in particular.
 *
 * A NOTE ON HOW THIS SUITE IMPORTS ITS SUBJECT, because it is load-bearing for the revert gate.
 * The production surface is taken through a NAMESPACE import and each symbol is then asserted by a
 * named cell. A named import (`import { UNATTENDED_MS } ...`) would make a tree with the fix
 * reverted fail at module instantiation with `does not provide an export named`, which is a
 * SyntaxError before any assertion runs: red, but red for the wrong reason, and indistinguishable
 * from a typo in the import list. Reverting the fix must fail a cell that says what was lost.
 *
 * Run: `pnpm smoke:seat-orphan`
