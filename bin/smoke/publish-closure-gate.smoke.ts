/**
 * The release workflow must gate the GitHub Release on a full-closure verification of every package
 * in the lockstep group, not on a single `npm view` of one package (#1286). And the closure verifier
 * must read the response body on a 200, not just the status (#1257).
 *
 * This smoke has two sections:
 *
 * A. Workflow shape — parses `.github/workflows/changesets.yml` and asserts that the Release step
 *    depends on a prior closure-gate step, anchored on step ids. A positive-control fixture with
 *    the gate removed must fail the same assertion, so the check is shown to discriminate. The
 *    rc-branch cells grade each branch body by the status bash gives it, not by its text (#1518).
 *
 * A2. The step end to end, runs the closure-gate step's own script under `bash -e` with `node`
 *    stubbed to each exit code the verifier documents, and asserts the status the step leaves, the
 *    `closure_ok` it publishes, and that the two quiet-skip arms end the step themselves. Grading
 *    arms in isolation cannot see a `trap` above the chain or a line below the `fi`, and either one
 *    turns a no-publish push red with every arm still reading as correct (#1518).
 *
 * B. Fake-registry gate — starts a local HTTP server returning controlled responses and runs the
 *    closure verifier against it. Four states: all present passes; one missing reds; one 200 with
 *    a wrong-version body reds; one 200 with an error body reds.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:publish-closure-gate
 * Prove: pnpm mutation-proof --config bin/smoke/mutations/publish-closure-gate.json

// failing too, and while the arm fell out of the `fi` it did not decide that: every later line got
// a vote. Two shapes turned the quiet skip into a red job with all four arms still reading as
// correct -- `trap "exit 1" EXIT` installed in the prologue above the chain, and a tidy-up
// `exit $rc` added below the `fi`. Neither is inside an arm, so no amount of care in reading arms
// can see either one, and the per-body cells stayed green through both.
//
// The arms now end the step themselves, which is what makes the second shape inert: rc 2 and rc 3

// trap fires on the arm's own `exit`, so it still has to be caught by measurement.
