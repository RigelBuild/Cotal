/**
 * Run a round-robin SHARD of the `smoke:ci` chain, so CI can fan the (serial) protocol/security
 * suite across N parallel runners without dropping or duplicating a single smoke.
 *
 *   node bin/smoke/shard.mjs <shardIndex> <shardCount>
 *
 * The frozen legacy list is read from `bin/smoke/ci-suites.txt`; new suites are one-file fragments
 * under `bin/smoke/ci-suites.d/`. Legacy entries keep round-robin `index % count`. Fragment entries
 * use a stable hash of their suite name, so an independently-merged fragment cannot move another.
 * Each smoke runs in its own `pnpm` subprocess (separate broker/ports) exactly as the serial chain
 * does; the shards run on SEPARATE runners, so there is no cross-smoke port contention within a shard.
 *
 * Exit status is not enough. A suite that returns 0 having run zero cells is the same false green
 * as an empty chain; the runner parses a cell-count sentinel from the suite's own output and refuses
 * a missing sentinel or a zero-cell run, naming the suite and the reason.
