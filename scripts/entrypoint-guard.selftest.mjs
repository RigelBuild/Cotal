/**
 * Every CLI under `scripts/` must behave the same whether its path is a symlink or not.
 *
 * The defect this grades is silent and points the safe way round: a gate whose entry guard
 * compares `process.argv[1]` against `import.meta.url` as strings never runs its `main()` through
 * a link, prints nothing, and exits 0. Measured on main before this suite existed, with a macOS
 * checkout reached through `/tmp` (a symlink to `private/tmp`): `check-attribution.mjs` with no
 * arguments refused with its usage line and exit 2 by its real path, and printed nothing at exit 0
 * by the linked one. Its `--selftest` exits 0 on a pass, and through the link it also exited 0,
 * having printed nothing. Nothing downstream can tell either apart from a clean run.
 *
 * Two kinds of cell, because the scripts split into two kinds.
 *
 *   PARITY, for the six that have an invocation which refuses before doing any work: run the
 *   script by its real path and through a symlink. Both runs must reach that script's own refusal,
 *   its exit code and a stderr line that only its `main()` prints, and the two must agree on exit
 *   code, stdout and stderr. Agreement alone is not the grade: two runs that both skip `main()`
 *   agree perfectly, at exit 0 with nothing on either stream. This is the live grade, and it is
 *   what the registered mutants redden.
 *
 *   CENSUS, for the two that cannot be spawned safely. `post-publish-install-probe.mjs` and
 *   `preflight-npm-publish.mjs` start their work at entry with no argv that refuses first, so
 *   there is no probe for them that does not pack a tarball or read the registry. They are graded
 *   on the source instead: the entry-point question is asked in one place, and a hand-rolled
 *   comparison written on one line of a top-level `scripts/*.mjs` file is refused. The census
 *   carries a planted control in each direction, so a census that has stopped looking fails rather
 *   than passing quietly. What it cannot see is listed in `scripts/mutations/entrypoint-guard.json`.
 *
 * Cells run to the end and each prints its own line: a mutation that reddens two of them must
 * still be readable as reddening the one it names.

/**
 * One invocation per script that refuses before it does anything. Each was measured by hand first:

 *
 * `status` and `stderr` are the witness that `main()` ran: the exit code of that refusal and one
 * whole line of the diagnostic it prints. Neither is enough alone. A guard that runs `main()` but
 * drops its return value prints the line and exits 0, which only the code catches.
 * `live-job-conclusion.mjs` refuses with 1, which is also what Node exits with when the script
 * cannot load at all, which only the line catches. `doc-binding.mjs` and `pr-head-gate.mjs` have no
 * function called `main`; the CLI body inside their guard plays that part.
