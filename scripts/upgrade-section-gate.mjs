/**
 * Does every BREAKING change carry an operator upgrade section?
 *
 * The defect this exists for (Cotal #1578): 0.49.0 changed how a credential's authority is
 * recorded, an operator with an existing 30-agent deployment could not tell whether their
 * credentials survived or which side of a split topology to upgrade first, and the repository
 * carried no UPGRADING.md at all. The release body was 35k characters and mentioned migration
 * nowhere. Nothing in CI noticed, because nothing was looking.
 *
 * So this looks. A change is BREAKING when it says so in the vocabulary this repository already
 * uses, and it must be accompanied by a section in `docs/UPGRADING.md`.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS BREAKING, and why it is not the changesets bump level alone. The obvious design
 * is "a changeset at `major`". Measured before building this: the tree carries ZERO changesets at
 * `major`, and none is reachable in history either, while 0.49.0 broke a deployment anyway. A gate
 * keyed on that marker would have an accept control that returns nothing, would pass forever, and
 * would be a gate grading nothing. The markers this repository ACTUALLY uses are the conventional
 * `!` in a commit subject (`feat(core)!: …`) and the `BREAKING CHANGE` footer; the
 * v0.48.2..v0.49.0 range carries two of the former. So all three are accepted as the breaking
 * signal, and the `major` changeset is included so the gate is already correct on the day someone
 * writes one rather than needing a second change then.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A SECTION. An `##` or `###` heading under `docs/UPGRADING.md` that is not one of
 * the page's structural headings. The check is deliberately shallow about the section's CONTENT:
 * a gate that graded prose would be a gate people route around, and the reviewer is better placed
 * to judge whether a section is any good. What it can enforce is that the section EXISTS and is
 * not empty, which is the part that silently does not happen.
 *
 *   node scripts/upgrade-section-gate.mjs --self-test   grade this tool against its own controls
 *   node scripts/upgrade-section-gate.mjs --base <ref>   check <ref>..HEAD
 *   node scripts/upgrade-section-gate.mjs --range a..b   check an arbitrary range (replay a release)
 *   node scripts/upgrade-section-gate.mjs --merge-snapshot   check a pull request's own range,
 *       derived as HEAD^1..HEAD from a checked-out merge commit. Refuses anything else, because
 *       on a single-parent checkout HEAD^1 is the previous commit and the range silently shrinks.
 *
 * Exit 0 when every breaking commit in range is covered, 1 when one is not, 2 on misuse.

 *
 * The comparison is deliberately by section TITLE rather than by content. A range that edits an
 * existing section does not read as coverage, which is correct: amending the 0.48.2 section is not
 * documenting a 0.50.0 break. It also means the gate cannot be satisfied by rewording, only by
 * writing something that was not there.
 *
 * What it still does NOT do is match a breaking commit to a SPECIFIC section, because a release's
