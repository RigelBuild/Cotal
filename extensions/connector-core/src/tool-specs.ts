Agents own their reasoning and conversations; the workflow specifies when they act and which outcomes determine the next step.\n\nBefore writing a program, read cotal_docs pages `workflows` and `lang-card`. Hosted execution requires a running manager, the `run` capability, and static authentication with issued caller authority; open and user-auth meshes refuse hosted runs. `@cotal-ai/lang` provides validation and simulation separately; those are not verbs of this tool.\n\nSTART: pass `verb: \"start\"` and the program text in `source`. Example: `{\"verb\":\"start\",\"source\":\"await sleep(\\\"1s\\\", { name: \\\"first-run\\\" });\"}`. Optional `file` labels diagnostics only; it reads nothing from disk. The manager validates before recording the run and returns a runId. Acceptance is not completion.\n\nINSPECT: use `verb: \"status\"` with that `runId` for state and step journal, or `verb: \"ps\"` to list runs. Both are read-only. Report completion only after observing state `completed`; surface failures or unresolved steps.\n\nANSWER: first inspect status, then pass `verb: \"answer\"`, `runId`, the exact open `stepKey`, and, when requested, `value` matching the answer shape. An ask requires its requested record; a checkpoint can resolve without a value. `artifact` may name the evidence reviewed. Answer only with authority to make that decision; never invent an approval.\n\nRESUME: pass `verb: \"resume\"` and `runId` to continue a run from its recorded source. A held run appears as `released` in status. Do not start a duplicate run to continue it or resume one the manager is already driving.\n\nRuns continue independently of your session and can recover after a manager restart.

  // as strict as its renderers only if the strictness is not restated four times.
  //
  // `?? {}` is load-bearing, not tidiness: a spec authored without a shape used to pass through
  // schemaless, and every adapter's schemaless path accepts whatever it is handed. `cotal_roster`
  // with `{owner, actor}` therefore succeeded on all five hosts while this factory advertised that
  // it had closed the seam. A no-argument tool gets a closed EMPTY object, so the refusal is the
  // same refusal everywhere and "takes nothing" never degrades into "takes anything".
