/**
 * THE SEAT SIDE OF THE TURN RELAY, at the MeshAgent.
 *
 * The relay is pull-shaped: the seat polls `turn-pending` under its own self reach, surfaces the
 * payload into host context, and yields — explicitly through `yieldTurn`, or implicitly when the
 * host turn ends (the working→idle presence transition every adapter funnels through
 * `setStatus`). The load-bearing properties, one block each:
 *
 *   1. A pull that finds fresh turns buffers them, asks for ONE wake, and counts them as
 *      directed-strength in `pendingWake` — and the surface is TWO-PHASE: `peekPendingTurns` is
 *      pure (a lost frame costs nothing) and only `commitSurfacedTurns` arms anything.
 *   2. The poll is the reconciler: a turn gone from `turn-pending` was settled elsewhere
 *      (deadline, another yield path) and is dropped, never yielded into.
 *   3. The working→idle boundary yields `done` for every SURFACED turn — ending the host turn IS
 *      the done signal — and re-polls immediately.
 *   4. An UNSURFACED turn never auto-yields: a payload the model never saw is not "done".
 *   5. `yieldTurn` targets the oldest surfaced turn, validates a handoff's addressee, and a
 *      manager-refused yield leaves the entry for the reconciler instead of dropping it locally.
 *
 * No broker: the endpoint is swapped for a scripted stub (the `manager-invoke-verdict` pattern),
 * so every wire exchange is the suite's to script and count. Run: pnpm smoke:turn-intake
