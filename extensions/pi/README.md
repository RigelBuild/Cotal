# @cotal-ai/pi

Cotal as an extension for the operator's own [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi).
The package does not bundle Pi.

## Requirements

- Cotal (`cotal-ai`): Node 22 or newer.
- The Pi host: exactly `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@0.79.10` for this release, which needs
  Node 22.19 or newer.
- `pi` on `PATH` for managed spawning.


## Use

The published `cotal-ai` binary registers the connector:

```bash
npm install -g cotal-ai @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@0.79.10
cotal up
cotal spawn default --detach --agent pi
```

To make ordinary interactive Pi sessions mesh-capable, copy the standalone artifact once:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/extensions
cp node_modules/@cotal-ai/pi/dist/standalone.js ~/.pi/agent/extensions/cotal.js
```

The copied file has no repository-local or sibling-file imports. It activates only when a real
Cotal identity (`COTAL_NAME`, `COTAL_AGENT_FILE`, or `COTAL_LINK`) is present. Unrelated operator
settings such as `COTAL_HOME` and `COTAL_DEFAULT_AGENT` leave it inert. Pi SDK embedders using its
default resource loader discover the same file; embedders must bind extension lifecycle events as
required by Pi's SDK if they expect proactive delivery into an idle session.

## Delivery

Inbound traffic is injected as a `cotal-inbox` custom message. Visible inbox and send-tool text is
wrapped by Pi's own ANSI/grapheme-aware TUI wrapper, so emoji, CJK, and styled content obey the exact
same terminal-column invariant Pi enforces at render time. Its opaque batch details must appear
in Pi's `message_start` and in the exact provider `context`. A successful `after_provider_response`
confirms the batch early when the transport exposes an HTTP response; transports such as the Codex
subscription may omit that hook, so an exact context is confirmed instead by its following clean
  terminal boundary. Acknowledgement waits for that boundary and drains only the confirmed IDs,
  even when pull-only quiet traffic is interleaved ahead of them.

- Crash or quit before a terminal boundary: acknowledge nothing; durable traffic redelivers. A
  manager-owned Pi process crash reopens the exact Pi session in place (same Cotal lifecycle); a
  bounded crash loop retires the seat rather than respawning forever.
- Non-aborted `stop`, `toolUse`, and non-overflow `length` (positive output) are terminal and may
  commit confirmed work. Error, abort, zero/missing-output `length`, and unknown stop reasons retain
  the association in observable `waiting`; Pi exposes no retry-finality event, so retained work waits
  for a later proven terminal boundary.
- Overflow compaction with `willRetry`: retain the batch through Pi's automatic continuation.
- Watchdog or headless abort: never timer-replay while the original provider call may still run;
  managed restart is the safe recovery path.

The custom delivery path bypasses Pi's operator `input` transformation chain, because peer traffic
is attributed context rather than a human prompt. Provider hooks, tool hooks, and Pi's normal
permission/sandbox extensions still run. Replies remain deliberate model actions through
`cotal_dm`, `cotal_send`, or `cotal_anycast`; chat output alone is not sent to peers.

Quiet-channel ambient is never included in automatic or continuation batches. It remains buffered
until `cotal_inbox` explicitly surfaces and clears it; quiet `@mention`s remain automatic.

Pi resume, model variants, MCP sharing, and raw launch options are not implemented and fail loudly.
Persona files and `--model` are supported; an explicit spawn model wins over the persona file.

## Credits

The original Pi integration and inbox-turn design were contributed by
[Lanzelot1](https://github.com/Lanzelot1). Persona and model forwarding were contributed by
[TheReaperJay](https://github.com/TheReaperJay). Their authored commits remain in the integration
history; this package keeps the resulting Pi-specific code and behavior.
