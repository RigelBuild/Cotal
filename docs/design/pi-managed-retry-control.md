# Pi managed-session provider retry control

A design record, not shipped behavior. Every current-behavior claim names the file and function it
was read from; everything else is proposed. Pi paths are `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 0.79.10
`dist/`.

**Status:** draft. Implements RIG-4293 option 1 with the RIG-4543 boundaries and the RIG-4669 seat
root Matt approved, on Linux only (RIG-4707; see Resolved decisions). Managed Cotal Pi seats
disable Pi's automatic provider retry before the first provider turn. Operator sessions are
unchanged, and overflow compaction stays host-owned. PR #37 (RIG-4249) stays draft until this
control and the queued-inbound races are verified.

## Problem / Intent

`AgentSession._handlePostAgentRun` (`core/agent-session.js`) re-requests the provider after the turn
has ended: `if (this._isRetryableError(msg) && (await this._prepareRetry(msg))) return true;`. Extensions
cannot see this. `willRetry` reaches only session listeners (`_handleAgentEvent`), and
`auto_retry_*` goes only through `_emit`. Cotal's `PiDriver.onAgentEnd` (`extensions/pi/src/driver.ts`)
holds an error-ended turn. `retryHeldErrorOnInbound` then starts one fresh turn on new automatic
inbound. So an inbound that lands during Pi's backoff can drive a second recovery path for the
same batch [INFERENCE from those functions, not reproduced]. Intent: in every runtime a managed seat
builds, effective `retry.enabled === false` before Pi's next provider request. If that cannot hold,
Pi makes no further provider request in that process, the seat says why, and it exits. Operator
settings files are never written.

## Approach

**No dedicated Pi control exists.**

- `cli/args.js` has no retry or settings flag.
- `MainOptions` (`main.d.ts`) is only `{ extensionFactories? }`.
- `ExtensionContext` (`core/extensions/types.d.ts`) exposes no settings manager.
- `AgentSession.setAutoRetryEnabled` → `SettingsManager.setRetryEnabled` writes
  `this.globalSettings.retry.enabled` and calls `save()`, the forbidden operator write. Its only
  external caller is RPC `set_auto_retry` (`modes/rpc/rpc-mode.js`).

**Carrier: a per-seat agent dir (decision 1).** It combines two documented Pi features:

- `getAgentDir` (`config.js`) honors `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`;
- `SettingsManager.getRetryEnabled` returns `this.settings.retry?.enabled ?? true`.

`_prepareRetry` and `_willRetryAfterAgentEnd` re-read `getRetrySettings()` on every attempt, so a
correct file at every read is enough. `piConnector.buildLaunch` converges a seat dir:

- `settings.json` starts from the operator's settings at first launch. Later launches preserve
  existing seat-local settings and force only `retry.enabled: false`; operator changes to other
  settings do not overwrite seat-local edits for that lifecycle (RIG-4721 option A).
- a **fixed allowlist** of symlinks back to the operator agent dir;
- `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` pointed at the seat dir.

The Cotal extension then verifies the result in every runtime.

**Why links, and why a fixed list.** Pi derives all of its state from the agent dir. Each name below
comes from a source read in this session:

- **Files:** `auth.json`, `models.json`, `trust.json`, `keybindings.json`, `SYSTEM.md`,
  `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`, and context files `AGENTS.md`/`AGENTS.MD`/`CLAUDE.md`/`CLAUDE.MD`.
- **Dirs:** `sessions`, `extensions`, `skills`, `prompts`, `themes`, `tools`, `bin`, `npm`, `git`, `tmp`.

Sources: `getAuthPath`/`getModelsPath`/`getToolsDir`/`getBinDir`/`getSessionsDir` (`config.js`),
`ProjectTrustStore` (`core/trust-manager.js`), `DefaultResourceLoader` user roots and `SYSTEM.md`
lookup (`core/resource-loader.js`), `DefaultPackageManager` `npm`/`git`/`tmp`
(`core/package-manager.js`), and keybindings (`core/keybindings.js`).

Copying only what exists at launch would make state seat-local and short-lived:

- a `/login` writes a seat `auth.json` that the next launch loses;
- `ensureTool` re-downloads rg/fd into every seat dir;
- trust prompts repeat.

With a fixed list:

- **Files are linked even when missing.** Pi's first `writeFileSync` (e.g.
  `FileAuthStorageBackend.ensureFileExists`) then creates the operator file, which is what happens
  today.
- **Missing dirs are created in the operator dir**, as Pi would create them for an unmanaged run.
- Unlisted names (`pi-debug.log`, `*.lock`) stay seat-local.

**Converge, never delete.** `buildLaunch` also runs on the resume preflight-only path
(`Manager`: `if (preflightOnly) return { ok: true, … }`, `implementations/manager/src/manager.ts`).
Recovery and resume reuse the same `lifecycleUid`, so the seat dir may belong to a live Pi, and two
launches of one lifecycle may converge it at once. Deleting it would expose retry-on settings and
missing session files. Instead:

- operator settings are read only to seed a seat file that does not exist yet (decision 10);
- every launch validates the seat file itself, forces only `retry.enabled` to false, and derives
  the link set from the seat file, so a later operator edit cannot fail a relaunch;
- an existing link with the expected target is accepted, so a concurrent converge is not an error;
- a passing live seat is left unchanged, and a malformed seat file fails loudly;
- the session-state file is reset only after every refusal has passed, so a refused launch or
  preflight keeps the state `Manager.retainedSessionId` reads.

**Project override.** Pi builds one `SettingsManager` per runtime from the *session's* cwd:

- `createRuntime` in `main.js` is called with `cwd: sessionManager.getCwd()`;
- so are `AgentSessionRuntime`'s resume/fork paths (`core/agent-session-runtime.js`);
- no `process.chdir` exists in Pi.

`deepMergeSettings` (`core/settings-manager.js`) shallow-merges one level, and "for primitives and
arrays, override value wins". So a trusted project `.pi/settings.json` re-enables retry when it has
either:

- `retry.enabled` present and `!== false`;
- a `retry` that is not a plain object (`null`, `true`, `[]`).

Trust can change at reload (`DefaultResourceLoader` calls `settingsManager.setProjectTrusted`), so the
check ignores trust.

**Session directory (decision 9).** Pi takes the session dir from `--session-dir`, then
`PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`, then the merged `sessionDir` setting (`main`, `main.js`). `/resume`
opens a file and uses its parent dir (`SessionManager.open`, `core/session-manager.js`). Every
managed transcript must stay under the seat's `sessions` link, so:

- `buildLaunch` passes none of `--session-dir`, `--no-session` or `--mode`, and refuses a launch
  env that carries `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`;
- neither the seat file nor a project file may contain `sessionDir`;
- with a session, the check requires `ctx.sessionManager.getSessionDir()` to equal Pi's default
  dir for the session cwd under the seat dir. This catches every source, including `/resume` of a
  file elsewhere and an in-memory session, whose dir is `""` (`SessionManager.inMemory`).

Pi's `getDefaultSessionDirPath` is not exported, and `ReadonlySessionManager` omits
`usesDefaultSessionDir`, so `seatDefaultSessionDir` copies its rule:
``join(resolve(agentDir), "sessions", `--${resolve(cwd).replace(/^[/\\]/, "").replace(/[/\\:]/g, "-")}--`)``.
The runtime pin keeps the copy exact.

**Host contract.** The checks read files. They equal Pi's effective settings only when the host
builds its `SettingsManager` from those files, as the CLI does (`main.js`). An SDK host can pass
its own `settingsManager` to `createAgentSession` (`core/sdk.js`), and `ExtensionContext` exposes
no settings, so the extension cannot see it. Managed mode therefore requires the Pi CLI: the check
fails unless `process.env.PI_CODING_AGENT === "true"`, which only `cli.js` sets. An SDK host given
a managed env fails closed at load. This narrows the contract instead of proving the effective
value (Open questions, 1).

**Where the checks sit.** The check runs at every point where Pi can reach a provider, and every
failure closes the same one-way gate. Nothing throws. A factory throw fails closed only in the CLI:
the SDK loader records the error and drops the extension (`loadExtensionFactories`,
`core/resource-loader.js`), and only `main` (`main.js`) turns `getExtensions().errors` into exit 1.
A handler throw is caught by `ExtensionRunner.emit` (`core/extensions/runner.js`) and reported
through `emitError`, so it gates nothing.

- **At load.** The factory checks `process.cwd()`, because the load-time API has no cwd
  (`createExtensionAPI`, `core/extensions/loader.js`). On failure it registers only the barrier
  handlers below, starts no mesh runtime, and terminates. The extension stays loaded in every host.
- **In `session_start`.** It is emitted in `bindExtensions` before the initial prompt and on
  reload, new, resume and fork (`AgentSession.bindExtensions`, `AgentSession.reload`,
  `AgentSessionRuntime`). The check reads `ctx.cwd`, the session cwd that the runtime's
  `SettingsManager` was built from, plus `ctx.mode` and the session dir.
- **Before each request path.** `agent_start`, `session_before_compact` and `session_before_tree`
  re-run the same check while the gate is open. This covers a host that never calls
  `bindExtensions`; `createAgentSession` (`core/sdk.js`) does not call it.

An `input` handler cannot gate. `AgentSession.prompt` runs `_tryExecuteExtensionCommand` before
`emitInput`, and a command, a `withSession` continuation or any extension can call
`pi.sendMessage(…, { triggerTurn: true })`, which reaches the agent loop through
`sendCustomMessage` without `input`.

**Termination.** `closeRetryGate` sets the one-way gate before any fallible work. It then attempts
`driver.quit()`, persists session state `quit`, and writes a `pi connector:` reason to fd 2, each
in a separate guarded step. A failed step is recorded in the reason when stderr remains writable;
none can reopen the gate or skip termination. In a final guarded step it calls
`hooks.terminate(reason)` (default: own-process `SIGTERM`). Even if a test hook throws or returns,
`closeRetryGate` itself never throws and every provider-path handler parks or cancels based on the
already-closed gate. A host that prevents process termination must dispose the runtime; its
provider barrier remains closed until then.

Persisting `quit` lets `Manager.onAgentExit` retire a seat without `supervise`
(`freeSlot(a, true, "process-exit")`) instead of restarting it into the same failure (decision 2).
The id to persist is the existing runtime's `sessionId` when one exists for the key (after
`/reload`, or in any handler), else `COTAL_PI_EXPECTED_SESSION` at first load. A `--fork` launch
has no expected id, so a first-load failure writes nothing. `Manager.awaitReadiness` proves
presence only. The state file is read later, by `armSessionRecovery` → `awaitManagedSessionState`,
and only for a seat with `restart` and `control`. A first-load failure exits before the mesh joins,
so spawn or resume fails readiness on the exited process and reads no state. If persistence fails,
the manager must not infer a clean quit; this is a fail-loud lifecycle error, not permission for a
provider request.

At load, the CLI has no signal handler yet: `main` (`main.js`) builds the runtime, which loads
extensions, before `runPrintMode` or `InteractiveMode.init` registers one. The only `SIGTERM`
listener then is `signal-exit` 3.0.7, installed when Pi imports `proper-lockfile`; with no other
listener it unloads and re-raises the signal, so the process dies by `SIGTERM`.
Later, the CLI handlers run. Interactive `registerSignalHandlers` calls
`shutdown({ fromSignal: true })`, which awaits `runtimeHost.dispose()` and exits 0; print mode
(`print-mode.js`) disposes and exits 143. `AgentSessionRuntime.dispose` emits `session_shutdown`
and calls `AgentSession.dispose`, which aborts the agent without awaiting the turn. An SDK host
without its own handler dies the same way as at load.

`ctx.shutdown()` is not fail-closed. Print mode binds no `shutdownHandler`, so it is a no-op there.
Interactive mode's `shutdownHandler` (`InteractiveMode`) only sets `shutdownRequested` while
`session.isStreaming`, and a parked turn streams forever. `process.exit` is rejected: it skips
`session_shutdown` and terminal restore.

**Request barrier until exit.** A request can still start before the exit, for example from a
`withSession` continuation, which runs after `bindExtensions` (`finishSessionReplacement`). The
only `streamSimple`/`completeSimple` call sites in Pi's `dist/` give three request paths, and each
passes a Cotal handler first:

- **Turns.** The agent `streamFn` (`core/sdk.js`) runs only from `runLoop`, the only caller of
  `streamAssistantResponse` (pi-agent-core 0.79.10, `agent-loop.js`). `runAgentLoop` and
  `runAgentLoopContinue` first `await emit({ type: "agent_start" })`. `Agent.processEvents`,
  `AgentSession._handleAgentEvent` and `ExtensionRunner.emit` await each listener. Pi retry
  re-enters through `agent.continue()` (`_runAgentPrompt`), so it passes `agent_start` too.
- **Compaction.** `completeSimple` (`core/compaction/compaction.js`) runs only from `compact`,
  called by `AgentSession.compact` and `_runAutoCompaction`. Both emit `session_before_compact`
  first and stop on `cancel`: manual compaction throws `Compaction cancelled`, and auto compaction
  emits `compaction_end` with `aborted: true` and returns false. This covers the pre-prompt
  `_checkCompaction` in `AgentSession.prompt`, which runs before `agent_start`.
- **Branch summary.** `generateBranchSummary` (`core/compaction/branch-summarization.js`) runs only
  from `AgentSession.navigateTree`, after `session_before_tree`. `cancel` returns
  `{ cancelled: true }`.

With the gate closed, the `agent_start` handler awaits a promise that never settles, and both
`session_before_*` handlers return `{ cancel: true }`. The promise must never resolve or reject:
`streamAssistantResponse` has no aborted-signal precheck, and `emit` swallows a throw, so either
would let the request go out. A cancel wins over any other extension's result, because
`ExtensionRunner.emit` returns on the first `cancel`. Requests that an operator extension makes
from its own code are outside this record; they carry no Pi retry.

**No reopen.** The gate is one-way and never calls `PiDriver.hold`. `PiDriver.onSessionStart` never
clears `held`, so a hold would outlive any reopen. A seat whose checks pass dispatches exactly as
today.

**Nothing else turns retry on.** `SettingsManager` re-reads its files only in `reload()`, called
from `AgentSession.reload` and `DefaultResourceLoader.reload`; each is followed by a
`session_start`. The only in-memory switch, `setAutoRetryEnabled`, is reached only from RPC
`set_auto_retry`, which runs only under `--mode rpc` (`resolveAppMode`, `main.js`). `buildLaunch`
never passes `--mode`, and the check fails when `ctx.mode` is `"rpc"`.

**Runtime pin.** The binary is the operator's `pi` (`buildLaunch` returns
`opts.resolvedBinaries?.pi ?? "pi"`), not the devDependency. So managed mode imports `VERSION` from
the host package and refuses anything but `0.79.10`. The standalone bundle externalizes the package,
and the loader aliases it to the host copy.

**What stays the same.**

- **Overflow.** `_isRetryableError` excludes context overflow, and its compaction path reads only
  compaction settings.
- **No Pi re-request, but a post-run step remains.** An error `agent_end` no longer leads to a
  Pi-initiated re-request. However, `_handlePostAgentRun` still runs `_checkCompaction`, which can
  run `_runAutoCompaction("threshold", false)` after an error turn. Task 3 tests inbound arriving
  during that window.

**Rejected alternatives.**

- **Patching `SettingsManager.prototype` from the extension.** It reaches the host class through
  the loader alias but is not a supported API.
- **Blanking `errorMessage` at `message_end`.** It relies on an undocumented short-circuit in
  `_isRetryableError`, drops the error text that AG-UI `runError` uses, and blinds
  `isContextOverflow`.
- **`setRetryEnabled`.** It is an operator write.
- **A factory throw at load.** It fails closed only in the CLI. An SDK host drops the extension and
  runs without any gate.

## Global Constraints

- **Pi is exactly 0.79.10**, enforced at runtime and in `pi-sdk.smoke.ts`. A Pi bump re-verifies
  every Pi fact above.
- **Never write the operator's `settings.json`.** Operator-dir writes are limited to:
  - creating missing allowlisted dirs;
  - Pi's own writes through the links, as today.
- **Operator sessions are unchanged.** Every new check keys on `COTAL_PI_AGENT_DIR`, which only
  `buildLaunch` sets.
- **Fail loudly.** Every error starts with the `pi connector:` prefix and names the path. There is no
  fallback that keeps retry on.
- **Fail closed, one way.** A failed check, at load or in any runtime, ends the process
  (`closeRetryGate`). Nothing reopens the gate.
- **Host contract.** The managed host is the Pi CLI as `buildLaunch` starts it, in interactive or
  print mode (Approach, Host contract). It must let `hooks.terminate` end the process, or dispose
  the runtime itself; until then the barrier holds. Only `COTAL_PI_AGENT_DIR`, which `buildLaunch`
  sets, turns any of this on (decision 7).
- **Only `retry.enabled` is forced.** Compaction and `retry.provider.*` are copied unchanged
  (decision 6).
- **Seat dir:** `<seat root>/<name>-<lifecycleUid>`, private user state outside the shared
  workspace and outside `COTAL_HOME` (decisions 3 and 5). `seatAgentRoot` reads only the launch
  env, first match wins:
  1. `XDG_STATE_HOME`: `<XDG_STATE_HOME>/cotal/pi-agent`;
  2. `HOME`: `<HOME>/.local/state/cotal/pi-agent`.

  The order follows `globalConfigDir` (`packages/core/src/connector-config.ts`), which returns
  `join(xdg, "cotal")` for a set `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and else `join(homedir(), ".config", "cotal")`.
  The step 2 default is the XDG Base Directory one ("a default equal to `$HOME`/.local/state
  should be used"). `launchEnv` forwards both variables (`OS_ENV_ALLOW`,
  `extensions/connector-core/src/launch.ts`). Rules:
  - a value that is empty after `trim()` counts as unset, as in `globalConfigDir` and the XDG spec;
  - a relative value throws, naming its variable; it is never resolved against the cwd. The XDG
    spec calls a relative path invalid and says to ignore it. Ignoring it would move every seat
    dir to the next step without a word, so this refuses instead (Fail loudly);
  - with `XDG_STATE_HOME` unset, a missing `HOME` throws. There is no `os.homedir()` fallback,
    which falls back to a passwd lookup;
  - `COTAL_HOME` and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` are never read. `cotal service install` points both into
    `serviceStateDir` (`<unit dir>/cotal-service/<spaceKey>/`), and `uninstall` runs
    `rmSync(serviceStateDir(dir, fields.mesh), { recursive: true, force: true })`
    (`implementations/cli/src/commands/service.ts`). A root under either would lose retained seat
    dirs.

  The root and the seat dir are created with `mkSecretDir` (`packages/core/src/secret-fs.ts`):
  `mkdirSync(…, { recursive: true, mode: 0o700 })`, then `hardenPrivate`, which chmods it to 0o700.
  - `buildLaunch` validates both parts of `<name>-<lifecycleUid>` before any path is joined from
    them. `assertValidName` (`packages/core/src/resolve.ts`) refuses `/` and `\` in the name.
    `assertLifecycleToken` (`packages/core/src/subjects.ts`, `/^[a-z0-9]{26,32}$/`) checks the
    uid. So the leaf is one path segment, and the seat dir and the session-state file stay
    contained in their roots. The name stays raw (decision 8).
  - The uid is minted once per lifecycle (`mintLifecycleUid`) and reused by recovery and resume.
    So the dir is unique across workspaces, and `--session-id` recovery reopens the same session
    path string.
  - Fork `parentSession` headers record seat paths (`SessionManager.forkFrom`), because Pi uses
  `resolvePath`, not `realpath`. Retention (decision 5) keeps those paths resolvable.
- **Operator agent dir:** the launch env's `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` if the operator forwarded it via
  `envAllow` (`launchEnv`), else `join(HOME, ".pi", "agent")`, with `~` expanded against `HOME`.
  `HOME` is what `os.homedir()` reads first on Linux (Node `os` docs), and Pi's `getAgentDir`
  (`config.js`) calls `homedir()`. A missing or relative `HOME` throws, with no `os.homedir()`
  fallback.
- **Linux only (RIG-4707).** Links are symlinks, and a link that cannot be made fails loudly. No
  task adds a win32 or macOS branch, path, link type or test cell (decision 8).
- **Prerequisite: PR #44 merges first.** "ci: retire Windows workflow (RIG-4424)" removes
  `.github/workflows/windows.yml`, whose required "Unit tests" step runs `pnpm test` on
  `windows-latest`. The `extensions/pi` `test` script runs `pi.smoke.ts` and `pi-sdk.smoke.ts`,
  whose new cells are Linux-only. Task 1 starts after PR #44 merges.
- **One PR, no inert flag.**

## Plan

### Task 1: converge the seat dir in `buildLaunch`

New file `extensions/pi/src/retry-control.ts`:

```ts
export const COTAL_PI_AGENT_DIR = "COTAL_PI_AGENT_DIR";
export const PI_VERSION = "0.79.10";
export function operatorAgentDir(env: Readonly<Record<string, string | undefined>>): string;
/** `<root>/pi-agent` for managed Pi seats, from the launch env only (Global Constraints, Seat
 *  dir). Pure: creates nothing. Throws "pi connector: …" naming the variable on a missing or
 *  relative value. */
export function seatAgentRoot(env: Readonly<Record<string, string | undefined>>): string;
/** Idempotent and safe against a live seat. Throws "pi connector: …". Never deletes. */
export function convergeSeatAgentDir(seatDir: string, operatorDir: string): void;
```

`convergeSeatAgentDir`:

1. **Refuse unsafe seat paths.** `lstat` the seat root (`dirname(seatDir)`) and `seatDir`; a
   symlink throws. Then `mkSecretDir` both. `lstat` `<seatDir>/settings.json`: a symlink or a
   non-regular file throws, because Pi's `FileSettingsStorage.withLock` saves through
   `writeFileSync`, which follows a link.
2. **Seed on first launch only.** If `<seatDir>/settings.json` is absent:
   - read `<operatorDir>/settings.json`, or use `{}` if it is absent. Throw on JSON that does not
     parse, a value that is not a plain object, or legacy credentials: an `apiKeys` key, or
     `<operatorDir>/oauth.json` existing. `migrateAuthToAuthJson` (`migrations.js`) would
     otherwise copy them into each seat dir. The message is `run pi once to migrate them into
     auth.json`;
   - create the seat file as
     `{ ...op, retry: { ...(plain(op.retry) ? op.retry : {}), enabled: false } }` with
     `writeSecretFileCreateOnly` (`packages/core/src/secret-fs.ts`). On `EEXIST` a concurrent
     launch won; continue with its file.

   This is the only read of operator settings. Later steps read the seat file alone.
3. **Validate the seat file** on every launch. Throw on JSON that does not parse, a value that is
   not a plain object, an `apiKeys` key, or a `sessionDir` key, relative or absolute (decision 9).
4. **Check path entries** of the seat file: string entries, and object sources, of `packages`,
   `extensions`, `skills`, `prompts` and `themes`. Pi resolves a relative user-scope entry against
   the agent dir (`getBaseDirForScope`, `core/package-manager.js`), which is `seatDir`.
   - Strip one leading `!`/`+`/`-` marker.
   - Skip non-local sources (the `isLocalPath` prefixes in `utils/paths.js`), `~` paths and
     absolute paths.
   - For each remaining entry, compute `r = relative(seatDir, resolve(seatDir, e))`. Throw unless
     `r` is non-empty and contained: `r !== ".."`, `!r.startsWith("../")` and `!isAbsolute(r)`.
     This is the one-direction `contained` predicate inside `overlaps`
     (`implementations/cli/src/commands/backup.ts`), so a name such as `..foo` passes.
   - Throw if the entry's first segment has glob metacharacters. Otherwise add that segment to the
     link set.
5. **Force retry off.** If the seat file's `retry` is not a plain object or `retry.enabled !==
   false`, replace the file with `writeSecretFileAtomic`, keeping every other field. Never re-copy
   operator settings into an existing seat file.
6. **Converge the links.** For each name in the allowlist plus the link set, the target is
   `join(operatorDir, name)`:
   - a missing allowlisted operator dir is created first with `mkdirSync(…, { recursive: true })`;
   - attempt `symlinkSync(target, entry)`. On `EEXIST`, `lstat` the entry: a link whose
     `readlinkSync` equals the target is accepted, because an earlier launch or a concurrent
     converge made it; a link with another target is swapped through a uniquely named temp link
     and `renameSync`; anything else throws.

In `piConnector.buildLaunch` (`extensions/pi/src/connector.ts`):

- **Validate the leaf first.** After the existing argument refusals and before `stateRoot`:
  - throw `pi connector: a managed Pi seat requires lifecycleUid for its private Pi agent
    directory` when `lifecycleUid` is missing;
  - call `assertLifecycleToken(opts.lifecycleUid, "pi connector: lifecycleUid")`;
  - call `assertValidName(opts.name)`. `CotalEndpoint` (`packages/core/src/endpoint.ts`) already
    runs `assertValidName(opts.card.name)` on every join, so a name with `/` or `\` cannot reach a
    live seat today.

  `cotal spawn` can take the uid from a remote provisioning response, and
  `checkRemoteAgentMaterial` (`implementations/cli/src/commands/spawn.ts`) checks it only as a
  non-empty string. Today that value reaches
  ``join(stateRoot, `${opts.name}-${opts.lifecycleUid ?? "unmanaged"}.json`)`` and then
  `rmSync(sessionStatePath, { force: true })`, so an unchecked uid such as `x/../../victim` deletes
  `<workspaceRoot>/.cotal/victim.json`. A `relative`/`startsWith` check on the joined path would
  not be enough here: `join` normalizes the `..` away first, and the session-state `rmSync` runs
  before the seat root is known.
- **Drop the dead fallback.** That join uses the validated uid, and `?? "unmanaged"` is removed.
  The spelling `<name>-<lifecycleUid>.json` does not change, so the two readers that derive it,
  instead of reading a carried path, keep finding what new launches write:
  `Manager.retainedSessionId` (`implementations/manager/src/manager.ts`), for an inventory entry
  with no `sessionId`, and `sessionStatePath` in `extensions/pi/src/extension.ts`, for a seat
  launched before `COTAL_PI_SESSION_STATE` existed. An entry has no `sessionId` when the seat's
  readiness was uncertain, because `resumeEntry` reads one only once recovery is armed
  (`a.restart?.armed ? this.readManagedSession(a) : a.launch.sessionId`). Neither reader changes.
- **Refuse a session-dir env.** After `env` is built, throw `pi connector: a managed Pi seat cannot
  use PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` if `env.PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` is defined. Only
  `envAllow` can bring it (`launchEnv`, `extensions/connector-core/src/launch.ts`).
- **Converge the seat dir** after that check and before the persona temp dir:
  - `root = seatAgentRoot(env)`, ``leaf = `${opts.name}-${opts.lifecycleUid}` ``,
    `seatDir = join(root, leaf)`;
  - throw `pi connector: seat dir ${seatDir} escapes ${root}` unless
    `dirname(seatDir) === resolve(root) && basename(seatDir) === leaf`. The leaf checks above make
    this hold by construction; the assert keeps it holding if the leaf format changes. Unlike a
    `relative(root, seatDir) === leaf` test, it fails for `../x-<uid>`, because `join` has already
    normalized the `..`;
  - `convergeSeatAgentDir(seatDir, operatorAgentDir(env))`;
  - set `env.PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` and `env.COTAL_PI_AGENT_DIR` to `seatDir`.
- **Reset session state last.** The path string is still computed early, because the env carries
  it. `mkSecretDir(stateRoot)` and `rmSync(sessionStatePath, { force: true })` move to just before
  `return`, after every refusal, including convergence and the prompt checks. They become:
  - `ensureDirNoSymlink(workspaceRoot, ".cotal", "pi-sessions")` (`packages/core/src/fs-safe.ts`),
    which throws `refusing to write under "<dir>": it is a symlink` (or `not a directory`) for
    either component, then `hardenPrivate(stateRoot, "dir")`;
  - `unlinkFileNoFollow(sessionStatePath)`, which refuses a symlink or a non-regular file.

`LaunchOpts.lifecycleUid` stays optional in `packages/core/src/connector.ts`: requiring it changes
the public type for every connector. Pi refuses at runtime instead. That is a behavior change for
SDK callers of `piConnector.buildLaunch` (exported from `@cotal-ai/pi`) that omit the uid. Every
production launcher passes one: `Manager` spawn and resume, the `Manager` restart path (it reuses
the spawn opts) and `cotal spawn`. The seat dir does not depend on `workspaceRoot`.

**Tests** (`pi.smoke.ts`). The cells are Linux-only (RIG-4707) and add no win32 skip, so Task 1
needs PR #44 merged (Global Constraints, Prerequisite).

Resolver cells call `seatAgentRoot(env)` with literal paths and create nothing:

- `{ XDG_STATE_HOME: "/s", HOME: "/h" }` gives `/s/cotal/pi-agent`;
- `{ HOME: "/h" }` gives `/h/.local/state/cotal/pi-agent`;
- `{ XDG_STATE_HOME: "  ", HOME: "/h" }` gives the `HOME` default;
- adding `COTAL_HOME` and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` to any cell above leaves its result unchanged;
- each refusal names its variable: `XDG_STATE_HOME: "state"`, no `HOME`, and `HOME: "h"`.

Launch cells run `buildLaunch` with a temp `HOME`, a temp `XDG_STATE_HOME`, temp `COTAL_HOME` and
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, and a fake operator dir. Assert:

- the env vars are set, and the seat dir is
  `<XDG_STATE_HOME>/cotal/pi-agent/<name>-<lifecycleUid>`, with mode 0700;
- nothing is created under `COTAL_HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `<workspaceRoot>/.cotal/pi-agent`;
- the seat settings are `{ enabled: false, maxRetries: 7 }` and other keys are kept;
- every allowlisted link exists, including a dangling `auth.json`;
- missing dirs were created in the operator dir;
- the operator `settings.json` bytes are unchanged;
- a second call with the same uid leaves link inodes, seat settings bytes and a planted
  `pi-debug.log` intact; this exercises the `EEXIST` path a concurrent converge takes;
- a seat-local settings edit survives a relaunch, while retry stays false;
- after the first launch, an operator `settings.json` that does not parse, or that gains `apiKeys`,
  `sessionDir` or an escaping entry, neither fails a relaunch nor changes the seat file;
- a seat-file-only entry `extensions: ["mine/x.ts"]` links `mine` to `<operatorDir>/mine`;
- a planted link with a wrong target is swapped to the expected one;
- a call with a second uid leaves the first seat dir and its `settings.json` bytes in place;
- with `XDG_STATE_HOME` unset and `COTAL_HOME=<svc>`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME=<svc>/config` as a service
  unit sets them, `rmSync(<svc>, { recursive: true, force: true })` (what `uninstall` does to
  `serviceStateDir`) leaves the seat dir under `<HOME>/.local/state/cotal/pi-agent`, with its
  `settings.json`;
- `rmSync(seatDir, { recursive: true })` leaves operator files in place;
- the `envAllow` forwarded dir is honored;
- `launch.sessionStatePath` and `env.COTAL_PI_SESSION_STATE` both equal
  ``join(workspaceRoot, ".cotal", "pi-sessions", `${name}-${lifecycleUid}.json`)``, the path
  `Manager.retainedSessionId` derives. The absent-`sessionId` resume cells in
  `implementations/manager/smoke/pi-session-recovery.smoke.ts` ("an older inventory recovers the
  exact session from lifecycle-keyed upgrade state" and its fail-loud twin) already cover that
  reader, so they do not change.

Each refusal case throws its message:

- `apiKeys`, or `oauth.json` present;
- `extensions: ["x/../../e.ts"]`;
- an operator `sessionDir`, relative or absolute, at first launch;
- a seat file with `sessionDir` or `apiKeys`; a planted session-state file survives byte-for-byte;
- `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` forwarded through `envAllow`;
- a symlinked seat `settings.json`, whose target bytes stay unchanged;
- a symlinked `<workspaceRoot>/.cotal`, a symlinked `<workspaceRoot>/.cotal/pi-sessions`, and a
  symlinked session-state file, each leaving its link target untouched;
- a relative `XDG_STATE_HOME`, and nothing is created under the cwd;
- no `HOME` and no forwarded `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`;
- a symlinked seat root;
- a real dir at an allowlisted name;
- no `lifecycleUid`;
- `lifecycleUid: "x/../../victim"` throws `not a valid lifecycle token`. A planted
  `<workspaceRoot>/.cotal/victim.json` survives, and nothing is created under the seat root;
- `name: "../x"` with a valid uid throws `invalid name`. A planted
  `<workspaceRoot>/.cotal/x-<uid>.json` survives, and `<dirname(root)>/x-<uid>` does not exist.

Existing smokes change with the new refusal:

- **`pi.smoke.ts`.** Every call that should build, or reach a refusal after the uid check, passes a
  valid `lifecycleUid`. That covers events without `workspaceRoot`, `creds` with `userAuth`, and the
  prompt refusals. The `/workspaceRoot/` cell becomes
  `buildLaunch({ space: "test", name: "pi", lifecycleUid })`, so it still proves the events
  refusal, not the uid one. The `resume`+`continueSession`, `variant`, MCP and launch-options
  refusals run before the uid check and stay as they are.
- **`pi-sdk.smoke.ts`.** The `pi-events-sdk` launch passes a `lifecycleUid`. Its runtimes and the
  death stages (`SessionManager.create(root, join(root, "sessions"))`) set no
  `COTAL_PI_AGENT_DIR`, so the gate stays inert and they keep their custom session dir.
- **`bin/smoke/seat-env-scope.smoke.ts`.** It already passes `mintLifecycleUid()`.

All three set a temp `HOME` and a temp `XDG_STATE_HOME` before the first `buildLaunch`, so no smoke
converges a seat or creates operator dirs in the real user home.

### Task 2: verify in the extension

```ts
export type RetryCheck = { ok: true } | { ok: false; reason: string };
/** Load has only a cwd; a handler adds its mode and session. */
export type RetryCheckSite = { cwd: string; mode?: string; session?: { dir: string; cwd: string } };
/** { ok: true } unless env[COTAL_PI_AGENT_DIR] is set. */
export function checkManagedRetryOff(env: Readonly<Record<string, string | undefined>>, site: RetryCheckSite, hostVersion: string): RetryCheck;
/** Pi's default session dir for `cwd` under `agentDir` (Approach, Session directory). */
export function seatDefaultSessionDir(agentDir: string, cwd: string): string;
```

The check fails when any of these holds:

- `hostVersion !== PI_VERSION`;
- `env.PI_CODING_AGENT !== "true"` (Approach, Host contract);
- `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR !== COTAL_PI_AGENT_DIR`;
- `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` is set;
- the seat `settings.json` is a symlink, is missing, does not parse, has `retry.enabled !== false`,
  or has `sessionDir`;
- `<site.cwd>/.pi/settings.json` parses and either its `retry` is not a plain object or has
  `enabled` present and `!== false`, or it has `sessionDir`;
- `site.mode === "rpc"`;
- `site.session` is set and its `dir !== seatDefaultSessionDir(COTAL_PI_AGENT_DIR, site.session.cwd)`.

An unparseable project file passes, because `tryLoadFromStorage` then yields `{}`.

Wiring in `extensions/pi/src/extension.ts`. The default `cotalMesh(pi)` becomes a call to a new
export, passing `terminate: () => process.kill(process.pid, "SIGTERM")`:

```ts
export type CotalMeshHooks = { terminate(reason: string): void };
export function installCotalMesh(pi: ExtensionAPI, hooks: CotalMeshHooks): Promise<void>;
```

Gates live in a `globalThis` map, `Symbol.for("cotal.pi.retryGates")`, keyed by `runtimeKey`. The
map is global, like `RUNTIMES`, because the loader builds jiti with `moduleCache: false`
(`core/extensions/loader.js`), so module state does not survive a reload. `PiRuntime` keeps the
hooks of its first load. Module-private helpers:

```ts
type GateScope = { key: string; hooks: CotalMeshHooks; runtime?: PiRuntime; sessionId?: string };
/** Sets the gate first; catches every side-effect failure and always attempts termination. */
function closeRetryGate(scope: GateScope, reason: string): void;
/** Returns true when closed or when a failed check closes it; never throws. */
function gateClosed(scope: GateScope, site: RetryCheckSite): boolean;
```

`gateClosed` maps any exception from the check to a failure, because a throw inside
`session_before_compact` would be swallowed and compaction would run. A handler's site is
`{ cwd: ctx.cwd, mode: ctx.mode, session: { dir: ctx.sessionManager.getSessionDir(), cwd:
ctx.sessionManager.getCwd() } }`.

- **At load.** After `runtimeKey(config)`, read `runtimes.get(key)` without creating. The scope is
  `{ key, hooks: existing?.hooks ?? hooks, runtime: existing, sessionId: existing?.sessionId ??
  expectedSessionId }`. Call `gateClosed(scope, { cwd: process.cwd() })`. If it is closed, register
  only the three barrier handlers and return without creating a runtime. After `/reload`,
  `AgentSession.reload` re-runs the factory with `COTAL_PI_EXPECTED_SESSION` already consumed, so
  the existing runtime supplies the driver to quit and the session id to persist as `quit`. Never
  throw.
- **In `session_start`.** If the gate is set, return first, so a closed seat never writes
  `running` again. Otherwise run `gateClosed` on the handler site right after `runtime.sessionId`
  is set and before `persistSessionId(runtime.sessionId)`, and return if it is closed.
- **Barrier handlers.** Each starts with the gate test on the handler site, before any existing
  work:
  - `agent_start`: `if (gateClosed(scope, site)) await PARKED;`, with the module-level
    `const PARKED: Promise<never> = new Promise(() => {})`;
  - `session_before_compact`: `if (gateClosed(scope, site)) return { cancel: true };`, before
    `driver.onBeforeCompact`;
  - `session_before_tree`: the same, as a new handler.

**Tests:**

- **Unit cases.** Project `retry` values `{enabled:true}`, `null`, `true` and `[]` fail, and so
  does a project `sessionDir`. `{maxRetries:5}`, `{enabled:false}` and an unparseable file pass.
  These fail: a seat file with `enabled:true` or `sessionDir`, a symlinked seat file, a mismatched
  dir, `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` set, no `PI_CODING_AGENT`, `mode: "rpc"`, a session dir other
  than `seatDefaultSessionDir`, an in-memory session (`dir: ""`) and `hostVersion "0.80.0"`.
  `seatDefaultSessionDir(seatDir, cwd)` equals `SessionManager.create(cwd).getSessionDir()` with
  `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` set to the seat dir. With no `COTAL_PI_AGENT_DIR`, the check passes, which
  proves operator sessions are unchanged.

The runtime tests go in the broker-backed block of `pi-sdk.smoke.ts` (`nats-server`), where
`cotalMesh` already runs. `COTAL_PI_AGENT_DIR` and `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` point at a converged seat
dir, `PI_CODING_AGENT` is `"true"`, sessions use Pi's default dir, and `COTAL_PI_SESSION_STATE`
points at a temp file. Each runtime uses a distinct `COTAL_ID`, because gates and `runtimeMap` are
keyed by identity. "No request" means the faux provider's `state.callCount` did not move within
300 ms. Three ordering rules keep every test finite:

- a parked turn never settles, so no test awaits it;
- `AgentSession.compact` aborts and awaits `agent.waitForIdle()` before it emits
  `session_before_compact`, so no test calls `compact()` or `navigateTree` after starting a turn;
- `sendCustomMessage(…, { triggerTurn: true })` awaits the turn, so no closed-gate test awaits a
  trigger.

Cases:

- **Closed gate, every trigger.** Use the existing `createAgentSessionRuntime(createRuntime, …)`
  pattern with two factories: `(pi) => installCotalMesh(pi, { terminate: record })`, and one that
  registers `/kick`, whose handler calls `pi.sendMessage({ customType: "kick", content: "kick",
  display: true }, { triggerTurn: true })`. Close the gate by switching to a session whose cwd has
  `.pi/settings.json` `{ "retry": { "enabled": true } }`. Fire one trigger per fresh runtime,
  without awaiting it:
  - `prompt("/kick")` after the switch;
  - `prompt("typed")` after the switch;
  - the switch's own `withSession`, calling `ctx.sendMessage(…, { triggerTurn: true })`.

  Assert no request, that `record` ran once with a reason naming the project file, and that the
  session-state file reads `quit`.
- **Positive control.** The same `/kick` in a runtime on a passing cwd makes exactly one provider
  call, and `record` never runs.
- **Valid switch, automatic inbound.** Start an `installCotalMesh` runtime, switch to a second
  session on a passing cwd, then send one DM from the observer `CotalEndpoint` with `unicast`,
  which `agent.dm` uses. Assert exactly one more provider call, one `cotal-inbox` `message_start`
  carrying that id, and that `record` never ran.
- **Each handler re-checks.** One fresh runtime per path, on a passing cwd whose `session_start`
  passed, so the gate is open. Register the faux model with `contextWindow: 1000`, set
  `compaction` to `{ reserveTokens: 200, keepRecentTokens: 1 }`, and seed two user/assistant
  exchanges, the last assistant reporting `usage.totalTokens: 900`. Then write
  `{ "retry": { "enabled": true } }` to `<session cwd>/.pi/settings.json` and drive one path:
  - idle, `compact()` rejects with `Compaction cancelled`;
  - idle, `navigateTree(<the first user entry>, { summarize: true })` resolves
    `{ cancelled: true }`;
  - an unawaited `prompt("typed")` runs the pre-prompt `_checkCompaction`. A session listener sees
    `compaction_end` with `aborted: true` and `willRetry: false`, so `session_before_compact`
    closed the gate before `agent_start`;
  - on an unseeded session, an unawaited `prompt("typed")` parks at `agent_start`.

  Each asserts no request, that `record` ran once with a reason naming the project file, and state
  `quit`.
- **Compaction control.** The same seeded session on a passing cwd: `compact()` moves
  `state.callCount`, so the closed cases cannot pass on a session too small to compact.
- **First runtime fails at load.** `process.chdir` into the failing project, then build the first
  runtime. Assert that `getExtensions().errors` is empty, that `record` ran once, and no request
  after an unawaited `prompt("typed")`.
- **Load fails after reload.** Start a runtime on a passing cwd and let `session_start` persist
  `running`. Then `process.chdir` into the failing project and await `AgentSession.reload()`.
  Assert that `record` ran once, that the state reads `quit` with the runtime's session id, and no
  request after an unawaited `prompt("typed")`. The session cwd still passes, so only the load
  check can have written `quit`.
- **Host that never binds.** Load from a passing `process.cwd()` with a failing session cwd and the
  seeded history above, and never call `bindExtensions`. After an unawaited `prompt("typed")`,
  assert `compaction_end` with `aborted: true`, no request, and that `record` ran once.
- **No CLI marker.** With `PI_CODING_AGENT` unset, the first load fails closed: `getExtensions().errors`
  is empty, `record` ran once, and an unawaited `prompt("typed")` makes no request.
- **Session dir.** A runtime whose session manager is `SessionManager.create(cwd, <temp dir>)`, and
  one whose session cwd has a project `sessionDir`, each close at `session_start`. A runtime with
  `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` set closes at load. Each asserts that `record` ran once and no
  request.
- **Failure injection.** Make state persistence throw and make `hooks.terminate` throw, in separate
  runtimes with the seeded history. In each, write the failing project file, then:
  - idle, `compact()` rejects as canceled, which closes the gate;
  - idle, `navigateTree` returns canceled;
  - last, an unawaited turn makes zero requests.

  In the first, a recording termination hook is called exactly once despite the write failure, and
  the write error does not escape the Pi handler. In the second, the throwing hook is called
  exactly once and its error does not escape. A healthy-path control must make a request, so a
  broken faux provider cannot make both cases pass.
- **Pi CLI process runs.** Spawn `node <pi dist/cli.js> --extension <dist/standalone.js> --approve
  --provider cotal-test --model m`. The operator `models.json`, reached through the seat link,
  defines `cotal-test` with `api: "openai-completions"` and a `baseUrl` on a local HTTP server that
  counts requests and answers 400. Cases:
  - **load, print:** cwd is the failing project, with `--session-id <uuid> -p hi` and
    `COTAL_PI_EXPECTED_SESSION` set to that id. The child ends by signal `SIGTERM`, or with exit
    code 143 if `runPrintMode` registered its handler before the signal arrived, because
    `process.kill` delivers asynchronously. Either outcome passes;
  - **`session_start`, print:** cwd passes, with `--session <seeded file on the failing project>
    -p hi`. Exit code 143 from the `runPrintMode` handler;
  - **`session_start`, interactive:** the same without `-p`, under `ptySpawn`
    (`implementations/cli/smoke/_console-pty.ts`). Exit code 0 from
    `shutdown({ fromSignal: true })`;
  - **control:** the print case with a passing session cwd makes exactly one request and prints no
    `pi connector:` line.

  Every failing case asserts zero requests, stderr naming the project file, and state `quit`.

### Task 3: prove Pi honors the generated file

In `pi-sdk.smoke.ts` (existing smokes use `SettingsManager.inMemory`):

1. **Merge pins.** Build the seat dir with `convergeSeatAgentDir`, then run
   `SettingsManager.create(project, seatDir, { projectTrusted: true })`:
   - project `{retry:{maxRetries:5}}` gives `enabled === false`;
   - project `{retry:null}` gives `enabled === true`, pinning the hazard Task 2 gates.
2. **Runtime.** The managed setup of Task 2 (seat files, `PI_CODING_AGENT=true`, no
   `settingsManager` option), the faux provider, and `cotalMesh`. The first response is
   `fauxAssistantMessage([], { stopReason: "error", errorMessage: "503 service unavailable" })`. Wait
   2500 ms, longer than the 2000 ms first backoff. Assert:
   - no `auto_retry_start`;
   - `agent_end.willRetry === false`;
   - one provider call;
   - the driver is `held`.

   Then one automatic inbound must produce exactly one more call and a clean boundary.
3. **Control.** An operator session (no `COTAL_PI_AGENT_DIR`, so the gate is inert) with
   file-backed `{retry:{enabled:true, baseDelayMs:1}}`: assert `auto_retry_start` and two calls.
4. **Post-run compaction.** Same as step 2, with context above the compaction threshold, and an
   inbound delivered while threshold compaction runs. Assert:
   - no concurrent turns;
   - exactly one provider call after compaction;
   - the inbox is acknowledged once.

   A red result here blocks PR #37 promotion, per RIG-4293's queued-inbound-race gate, and is fixed
   in `PiDriver.retryHeldErrorOnInbound` on the RIG-4249 line.

### Task 4: docs and rollout

- **`docs/connect-pi.md`.** In the paragraph "Pi emits `agent_end` to extensions without exposing
  whether it will retry", add that a managed seat runs with Pi retry off through a per-seat agent
  dir, and that operator sessions keep the existing ambiguity.
- **`extensions/pi/README.md`.** Near "Pi exposes no retry-finality event", add:
  - the seat dir location, and that Cotal keeps one per lifecycle (decision 5);
  - the refused project `retry` values and `sessionDir` sources, and that a failed check ends the
    seat, including after a mid-session edit (decision 7);
  - that operator settings seed a seat only at its first launch, and that seat-pane settings
    changes persist only to the seat copy (decision 10);
  - the runtime pin, and that the Pi CLI is the managed host.
- **`docs/design/session-recovery.md` § 4.2.** Amend the adopted recovery-rule paragraph to match.
- **`docs/config.md`.** Add a § State files after § Configuration files: `pi-agent/` under the
  seat root, its precedence, that `COTAL_HOME` does not move it and `service uninstall` does not
  remove it, and that Cotal keeps one seat dir per lifecycle.
- **Changeset.** Add `.changeset/pi-managed-retry-off.md` (`"@cotal-ai/pi": patch`).
- **Rollout.** A seat gets the control at its next launch or supervised restart. Seats that are
  already running keep retry until then.

## Tasks

- [ ] Task 1: `operatorAgentDir`, `seatAgentRoot`, `convergeSeatAgentDir` and the `buildLaunch`
  wiring (uid validation, seat dir containment, `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` refusal, session
  state reset last and symlink-safe, no `unmanaged` fallback), with the Linux-only resolver,
  location, retention, relaunch, link, session-state, refusal and convergence tests and the smoke
  updates. Needs PR #44 merged first.
- [ ] Task 2: `checkManagedRetryOff`, `seatDefaultSessionDir`, the gate map, `closeRetryGate`,
  `gateClosed`, the load (including after `/reload`), `session_start` and barrier handlers, and the
  `installCotalMesh` seam, with the unit, every-trigger, positive-control, valid-switch,
  per-handler re-check, auto-compaction, load, reload, unbound-host, no-marker, session-dir,
  failure-injection and Pi CLI tests.
- [ ] Task 3: merge pins, the retry-off proof, the retry-on control and the post-run compaction
  race.
- [ ] Task 4: `connect-pi.md`, `README.md`, `config.md`, `session-recovery.md` § 4.2 and the
  changeset.

## Resolved decisions

Matt approved the RIG-4543 recommendation on 2026-10-06 ("Recommendation lgtm") and RIG-4669
option 1, the HOME/XDG state root ("Opt 1"). He ruled in RIG-4707 that Cotal is Linux-only and
drops all Windows support. Each entry gives the choice, the reason, and what lost.

1. **Carrier: per-seat Pi agent dir.** It uses only documented Pi inputs (`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`,
   `retry.enabled`). Rejected:
   - a Cotal launcher on the Pi SDK. `MainOptions` takes only factories, so `main.js` startup,
     trust and TUI wiring would be re-implemented against 0.79.10 internals;
   - waiting for an upstream control (a flag, an env var, or `willRetry` on the extension
     `agent_end`). None exists in 0.79.10 or the 1.0.2 changelog, and #37 would stay blocked.
2. **Project override: per-runtime check with termination.** The load check and the `ctx.cwd`
   check in every runtime close the gap and keep project resources. A failure ends the process
   instead of holding the seat, and the persisted `quit` retires it (Approach, Termination). A
   `supervise` seat still restarts on any exit (`restart.policy`), fails the same check, and
   retires as `supervise-crash-loop` at its policy limit; exempting it needs a manager change,
   which this record does not make. Rejected: `--no-approve`, which drops project
   extensions/skills/prompts and does not reach an SDK host; a load-only check, which misses
   resume or fork into another project.
3. **Seat dir: private user state outside the shared workspace and `COTAL_HOME`.** A shared
   workspace is reachable by everything else that uses it: other users, project tooling, agents
   confined to it. Seat-local files (`pi-debug.log`, `*.lock`) also stay out of project trees. The
   root is the user state root in Global Constraints (RIG-4669 option 1). It survives
   `cotal service uninstall`, and `COTAL_HOME` keeps the registry-only meaning `docs/config.md`
   gives it. Pi seats still run unconfined as the launching user (no sandbox in
   `extensions/pi/src`), so a same-user process can edit a seat dir. The symlink refusals, the
   containment check and the per-runtime check stay for that reason. Rejected:
   - `<workspaceRoot>/.cotal/pi-agent`, which is shared-workspace exposure;
   - `<COTAL_HOME>/pi-agent`. `uninstall` deletes a service's `COTAL_HOME`, dangling retained fork
     paths, and the root would widen `COTAL_HOME` past the registry.
4. **Credentials: linked.** `auth.json` and `trust.json` link to the operator files. The operator
   dir stays the one credential owner, and OAuth refresh tokens never fork. Accepted risk: OAuth
   refresh (`withLockAsync` → `lockfile.lock`) locks the canonical file, because `realpath`
   defaults to true in proper-lockfile 4.1.2. Sync `withLock` and the trust lock pass
   `realpath: false`, so they lock beside the seat link, and a seat's sync write does not exclude
   the operator's. Rejected: a copy at launch (a second secret copy per seat, and refresh tokens
   drift) and provider env keys only (breaks OAuth subscriptions).
5. **Retention: one seat dir per lifecycle, never deleted by Cotal.** No safe cleanup contract
   exists. Deletion can race a live seat (Approach, Converge, never delete). It needs a
   `LaunchSpec` cleanup field, a public API change in `packages/core/src/connector.ts`. It also
   dangles fork `parentSession` paths recorded through the seat dir (Global Constraints, Seat
   dir). A seat dir holds only `settings.json`, links and seat-local files.
   Retention holds because no Cotal command deletes the seat root. `service uninstall` removes only
   `serviceStateDir`, and `removeLocalState` (`implementations/cli/src/commands/clean.ts`) deletes
   "the stopped mesh's local state" by "paths relative to the root".
6. **Provider-internal retry: the operator's `retry.provider.*` is kept.** It runs inside one
   `streamSimple` call. The agent `streamFn` (`core/sdk.js`) passes
   `providerRetrySettings.maxRetries`, and the pi-ai 0.79.10 providers that read it default it to
   0 (`maxRetries: options?.maxRetries ?? 0`). Pi turn retry stays off either way. Forcing 0 would
   change opted-in operator behavior.
7. **Host scope: re-check before every request path, with the Pi CLI as the managed host.** The
   check runs at load, in `session_start`, and in `agent_start`, `session_before_compact` and
   `session_before_tree`, so a host that loads the extension fails closed even if it never binds.
   The file checks equal Pi's effective settings only for a host that builds its
   `SettingsManager` from the files, so managed mode requires the CLI marker (Approach, Host
   contract; Open questions). A project file edited mid-session ends the seat before Pi reloads
   it, a false positive in the safe direction. Rejected: a check at load and `session_start` only,
   because a host that never calls `bindExtensions` gets no session-cwd check; a load-time throw,
   because an SDK host drops the extension and runs ungated.
8. **Platform: Linux only (RIG-4707), with the raw seat leaf.** No task carries a win32 or macOS
   path, link type, env lookup or test cell. The leaf stays `<name>-<lifecycleUid>`. On Linux,
   `assertValidName` and `assertLifecycleToken` already make it one path segment, the
   containment assert still guards the join, and a NUL byte or an over-long name fails loudly in
   Node (`ERR_INVALID_ARG_VALUE`, `ENAMETOOLONG`, measured with `writeFileSync`) instead of
   resolving elsewhere. The raw spelling also keeps `Manager.retainedSessionId` and the
   extension's `sessionStatePath` fallback on the path new launches write. Rejected: a hex leaf
   and a case-insensitive env lookup. Their reasons were Windows file-name rules,
   case-insensitive file systems and Windows env casing, and the hex leaf needed a manager reader
   change.
9. **Managed session directory (RIG-4721 option A).** Reject any custom `sessionDir`, including
   absolute paths, from every source Pi reads: `--session-dir`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`,
   and seat or project settings (Approach, Session directory). Accepting one could share session
   state across lifecycles or leave fork parents outside the retained seat state. Unmanaged
   operator sessions keep their setting.
10. **Seat-local settings (RIG-4721 option A).** The first launch seeds the seat file from the
    operator's settings with retry disabled. A same-lifecycle relaunch reads, validates and links
    from the seat file alone and forces only retry off. Seat-local edits survive, and a later
    operator edit, even a malformed one, cannot fail recovery. Operator edits apply to new
    lifecycle seats only.

## Open questions

1. **SDK hosts in managed mode (Matt's decision).** The extension cannot read the
   `SettingsManager` an SDK host passes to `createAgentSession`, so it cannot prove retry is off
   there (Approach, Host contract). This record designs against option A.
   - **A (recommended): narrow the contract and check a marker.** Managed mode requires
     `PI_CODING_AGENT=true`, which only `cli.js` sets. A plain SDK host given a managed env fails
     closed at load. Cost: the marker is a declaration, not proof. Child processes inherit it, and
     a host that sets it but passes its own settings runs with whatever retry those hold.
   - **B: narrow the contract in prose only.** No marker check. An SDK host given a managed env is
     unsupported and fails open if it passes retry-on settings. Cost: a silent hole for any future
     SDK launcher.
   - **C: ask Pi upstream for an extension-visible effective retry setting**, such as retry state
     on `ExtensionContext`, and verify it once it exists. Cost: blocked on upstream, as in
     decision 1; A or B still applies until then.

   Decision needed: approve A, or choose B or C.
