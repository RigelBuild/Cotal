# Publishing a release

> **Project** (non-normative maintainer notes) · **For:** maintainers shipping Cotal

Cotal uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to version and publish the
workspace packages under `packages/*`, `extensions/*`, and `implementations/*` to npm.
`examples/**` is ignored, since it is not published.

> **This fork does not publish.** The `@cotal-ai/*` npm packages belong to upstream `Cotal-AI/Cotal`.
> Here the workflow is renamed `.github/workflows/changesets.yml.disabled`, so GitHub never runs
> it. The smoke suites still read it. Restore the `.yml` name only with a Rigel npm scope repoint.

## 0.11 runtime migration

The published binary no longer bundles the optional tmux and cmux runtimes. Existing operators
must run `cotal ext add @cotal-ai/tmux` or `cotal ext add @cotal-ai/cmux` once after upgrading,
before using `runtime: tmux|cmux` in a manifest or passing `--runtime tmux|cmux`. Missing runtimes
fail loudly with the matching install command; they never fall back to pty.

## Trusted publishing

Trusted publishing replaces the long-lived `NPM_TOKEN` secret with short-lived OIDC tokens
issued by GitHub Actions. Each published package must be configured once on npmjs.com.

The `fixed` group in [`.changeset/config.json`](../.changeset/config.json) is the list that
gets versioned and published. Derive the package list from it instead of
maintaining it by hand. It had drifted by six packages before this was last reconciled.

### Deployment Environment setup

Both publishing jobs (`version` and `snapshot`) reference a GitHub Environment named
`npm-publish`. The OIDC assertion rejects tokens that do not carry this environment claim,
so the Environment must exist and must protect the release ref before the first publish.

1. Go to **Settings > Environments** in the repository.
2. Create a new Environment named **`npm-publish`**.
3. Under **Deployment branches and tags**, select **Selected branches and tags** and add
   `main` as the only allowed branch. This restricts OIDC token issuance to runs on `main`.
4. Optionally add required reviewers if your team wants a manual gate before each release.

The Environment name is embedded in the workflow, in the OIDC identity assertion, and in
every npm trusted-publisher record. All three must use the exact string `npm-publish`.

> **Snapshot releases:** the snapshot job is also bound to the `npm-publish` Environment.
> If the deployment branch policy allows only `main`, snapshot releases from other branches
> are refused by the Environment gate before the OIDC exchange. To allow snapshots from
> additional branches, add those branches to the Environment's deployment policy.

### Per-package trusted publisher configuration

For **every** published package, `cotal-ai` (the binary), `@cotal-ai/core`,
`@cotal-ai/workspace`, `@cotal-ai/cli`, `@cotal-ai/manager`, `@cotal-ai/delivery`,
`@cotal-ai/web`, `@cotal-ai/cmux`, `@cotal-ai/orca`, `@cotal-ai/tmux`, `@cotal-ai/herdr`,
`@cotal-ai/connector-core`, `@cotal-ai/connector-claude-code`, `@cotal-ai/connector-hermes`,
`@cotal-ai/connector-opencode`, `@cotal-ai/connector-codex`, `@cotal-ai/pi`, `@cotal-ai/auth`:

1. Go to `https://www.npmjs.com/package/<name>/access` (e.g.
   `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cotal-ai/core/access`).
2. Scroll to **Trusted publishing** > **Add a trusted publisher**.
3. Pick **GitHub Actions**.
4. Fill in:
   - **Organization or user:** the GitHub owner (your org or user).
   - **Repository:** `Cotal`.
   - **Workflow filename:** `changesets.yml`.
   - **Environment name:** `npm-publish`.
5. Save. Repeat for every package.

> The first time, you may need to publish a version manually (with a classic token) so the
> package exists on npm. After that, OIDC takes over.

> **Migration from blank Environment:** if packages were previously configured with a blank
> Environment name, each must be updated to `npm-publish`. Delete the old trusted publisher
> record and re-create it with the Environment name filled in. The preflight will refuse any
> package whose trusted-publisher record does not carry the `npm-publish` environment.

## Day-to-day flow

1. Open a PR that changes code in a publishable package.
2. Add a changeset describing the change:

   ```bash
   pnpm changeset
   ```

   Pick the affected packages plus the semver bump (patch / minor / major), and write a
   one-line summary. Commit the generated `.changeset/<name>.md` file alongside your code
   change.
3. Merge to `main`.
4. The `Changesets` workflow runs:
   - If there are pending changesets, it opens (or updates) a PR titled `chore(release):
     version packages` that bumps versions and updates `CHANGELOG.md` files.
   - When **that** PR is merged, the same workflow detects the bumped versions, runs `pnpm
     build`, and `pnpm publish`es each changed package to npm with provenance.

## Publication workflow

`ci:publish` in the root `package.json` is:

- an exact-version census of every package in the Changesets fixed group against the registry;
- a check that the public recursive workspace set is the complete Changesets fixed group;
- one GitHub OIDC exchange per package when the release job exposes the OIDC requester;
- a GET of each package's trusted-publisher document with that exchanged token, which must list
  a direct `npm publish` Allowed action on THIS repository's `changesets.yml` publisher;
- only after those checks, the workspace build, native assembly, and recursive publish.

The census prints every package, version, OIDC result, and direct-publish result before it refuses.
If every exact version already exists, the preflight reports a no-op and exits successfully before
credential checks. A mixed census, incomplete fixed group, failed OIDC exchange, or stage-only
package exits before `pnpm publish`.

The post-publish closure gate checks every package in the fixed group. Registry observations cannot
distinguish a partial publish from slow propagation: clean 404s and repeated non-404 failures both
lack evidence that a package will never appear. The census therefore reports an incomplete or
errored closure as `UNSETTLED` and never fails the job on its own. Exit 1 remains reserved for future
positive publisher evidence.

Re-check a version that already shipped without publishing, tagging, or changing git:

```bash
node scripts/verify-publish-closure.mjs 0.52.0 --recheck
```

The publish job refuses an npm access token in its environment and publishes through OIDC only.
This prevents pnpm from falling back to a classic token when an OIDC exchange fails.

HTTP 201 from the OIDC exchange is identity only. npm's trusted-publisher Allowed actions always
permit `npm stage publish`; configurations created after 2026-09-03 default to stage and may omit
direct `npm publish`. Both paths use the same successful exchange, so the preflight never treats
that 201 as proof that sequential `pnpm publish -r` can write. Binding those Allowed actions to a
GitHub Environment is done: the `version` and `snapshot` jobs reference `environment:
npm-publish`, and the OIDC identity assertion rejects tokens without the matching
environment claim.

pnpm's `--batch` option was evaluated. It exists from pnpm 11.7 and is all-or-nothing only on a
registry implementing `PUT /-/pnpm/v1/publish` (pnpr does). npm's registry returns 404 for read-only
`GET` and `OPTIONS` probes of that endpoint, and its published Registry API does not document it.
pnpm batch publishing also rejects provenance and requires one shared credential for the batch
instead of the per-package OIDC exchanges used here. The repository stays on the normal npm publish
protocol and treats the preflight as the fail-before-first-write control.

```bash
node scripts/preflight-npm-publish.mjs && pnpm build && node scripts/seat-assemble-natives.mjs && pnpm publish -r --provenance --access=public --no-git-checks
```

- `preflight-npm-publish.mjs`: derive and print the full fixed-group package/version census. In
  GitHub Actions it exchanges a package-specific OIDC token, then GETs `/-/package/<name>/trust`
  and refuses unless THIS repository's `changesets.yml` publisher lists a direct-publish Allowed
  action. npm documents that identity on GET `/-/package/<name>/trust` as `claims.repository` and
  `claims.workflow_ref.file` with a `permissions` array. Other GitHub publishers on the same package
  are not proof that this job can publish. It refuses npm access-token environment variables before
  the census or OIDC exchange, so `ci:publish` cannot be used with a classic token.
- `pnpm build`: build every workspace package first, supplying local workspace dependency outputs
  when a partial retry publishes only the packages still missing.
- `seat-assemble-natives.mjs`: assemble the downloaded native seat artifacts before publication.
- Seat's pack and publish hooks assert both native artifacts and compile its JavaScript and type
  entrypoints without rebuilding the native helpers.
- `-r`: recursively publish all workspace packages.
- `--provenance`: emit SLSA provenance attestations (a no-op without OIDC, automatic with it).
- `--access=public`: required for scoped packages on first publish.
- `--no-git-checks`: skip pnpm's branch / clean-tree guard, since CI does not need it.
