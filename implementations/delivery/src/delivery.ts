 *

 * name), a provably dead pre-upgrade record reclaimed first so an upgraded root never holds both
 * spellings, then the #969 identity pin beside it. The pin goes with the record on the way out.
 *
 * The removal is pid-CHECKED, like the manager's: a daemon that exits must not delete a record that
 * already belongs to its successor (a fast restart writes the new pid before the old process has
 * finished unwinding), so the record goes only while it still names this process.

   *
   *  1. Comparing against `ownId` (the bare connection nkey `U…`) is comparing across NAMESPACES:
   *     the endpoint rewrites `card.id` in its constructor to the wire PRINCIPAL dot-form
   *     `${owner}.${actor}` (`local.U…`), and that is what `encodeLease` stamps. That mismatch made
   *     `held` UNREACHABLE, the daemon read its own row, failed to recognise itself, took the
   *     `taken` branch and exited naming ITSELF as the thief, leaving a not-ready row and no
   *     process. `held` is the one survivable reading ("your renew failed but the shard is still
   *     yours"), so making it unreachable turned every recoverable renew failure into a permanent
   *     withdrawal: #1318's own outage re-entering through the path built to prevent it.
   *
   *  2. Comparing on the principal ALONE is not sufficient either, and this is the one that looks
   *     correct: the daemon's cred is a FILE that every restart re-reads, so a REPLACEMENT daemon
   *     authenticates as the same nkey and writes the same `holder`. A displaced daemon would then
   *     read its successor's row, conclude the shard was still its own, carry on serving a shard it
   *     had lost (two daemons on one durable, which is the split this lease exists to prevent) and
   *     CAS-release the live holder's row on the way out. Cells F and G stage exactly that, with two

  // a row that is provably NOT ours (different holder or incarnation) or a real delete starts the
  // tree, which is exactly what the renew tick would have concluded one interval later.
  //
  // NO FALLBACK: the watch is part of the single-server guarantee, so a daemon that cannot
  // establish it refuses to start, loudly (the await below throws out of start-up and the

  //
  //   • MEASURED LOOP LAG. The gap between consecutive firings of a timer we own, minus its nominal
  //     period, is local starvation by direct measurement. It is credited back, so time this process
  //     spent off the runqueue is never counted against the broker.
  //   • COMPLETED NEGATIVE PROBES. Only a probe that RAN TO COMPLETION and returned false is
  //     evidence about the server. A probe that never ran contributes nothing (that was the whole
  //     defect: the window aged with no probe having failed), and one that REJECTED is an
  //     unanswered question, it now resets the counter and logs, where it used to be swallowed by
  //     `.catch(() => {})` and silently age the window.
  //   • TRANSPORT-LEVEL LIVENESS. A `transport: connected` edge from the endpoint's own connection
  //     cannot happen without a server on the other end, so it is positive evidence obtained for
  //     free, on a path that does not need this process to schedule a probe at all.
