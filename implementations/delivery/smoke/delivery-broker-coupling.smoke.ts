/**
 * delivery broker-coupling smoke. The delivery daemon is part of the server: it should survive a brief
 * broker blip (the endpoint reconnects), but if the broker is truly GONE it must EXIT rather than loop
 * reconnect-attempts forever — so it never outlives the broker it serves. This spawns the real daemon
 * (`cotal deliver`) against a throwaway broker with a short broker-gone window, confirms it comes up,
 * kills the broker, and asserts the daemon process exits on its own.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:delivery-broker-coupling   (needs `nats-server` on PATH; auth/JetStream, local-only)
