/**
 * delivery starvation-vs-broker-gone smoke, the live half of #1318.
 *
 * The daemon must exit when the broker is GONE and must NOT exit when its own process was merely
 * prevented from asking. Those two produced the same signal, and on 2026-09-05 the second one cost
 * Plane-3 nine minutes while `nats-server` had been up continuously for 7.3 days. So both are
 * graded here, against a real daemon and a real broker, in one run.
 *
 * HOW THE STARVATION CELL MAKES THE DAEMON UNABLE TO ASK WITHOUT MAKING THE BROKER UNAVAILABLE.
 * SIGSTOP on the daemon process. That is a faithful model of the reported condition rather than a
 * replica of it: the process is on no runqueue, so its 2s interval does not fire, its probes do not
 * complete, and its wall clock advances anyway, which is precisely the state the pre-fix predicate
 * misread. The broker is untouched and is confirmed reachable from THIS process throughout, so
 * anything the daemon concludes about it is a conclusion about itself. A CPU-burn model was
 * considered and rejected: it starves the runner too, so a green result would be indistinguishable
 * from a host that happened to schedule everything anyway.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE REFUSES TO CALL A PASS. Its predecessor observed only `daemonExited`, so a daemon
 * that never started graded its exit cell green, "exited because the broker went away" and "was
 * never running" were the same observation. Every cell here therefore asserts the daemon was ALIVE
 * immediately before the stimulus, and the exit cells additionally require the daemon's own
 * stderr to carry the broker-gone reason. The daemon is spawned with piped stderr for exactly that.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:delivery-starvation   (needs `nats-server` on PATH; auth/JetStream, local-only)

  // the pre-fix tree SURVIVES that, because the first probe after the resume succeeds and refreshes
  // the window before the predicate is next consulted. A cell that both trees pass grades nothing,
  // so it is kept for what it does prove (the daemon survives a stall and goes on renewing) and the
  // discrimination is done here.
  //
  // THIS is the mechanism the issue's own triage reproduced, and the one with no luck in it. The
  // daemon reaches the broker through a proxy that PRESERVES every already-established socket and
  // blackholes only NEW connections. The daemon's standing connection keeps working, so it is
  // serving the whole time; its 2s side-probe opens a fresh connection every tick, and each one
  // hangs until `isReachable`'s own deadline ends it and flattens it to `false`.
  //
  // WHAT SAVES THE DAEMON HERE IS THE OPEN TRANSPORT, AND ONLY THAT. An earlier draft of this
  // comment also claimed the probe answers were "far past their own budget" and therefore read as
  // starvation. That was wrong, and a reviewer's measurement is what showed it: a blackholed probe
  // is ended BY its own deadline, so it arrives AT the budget, not past it, and on an unstarved
  // host the server genuinely had that whole second and genuinely failed to complete a handshake.
  // Those are honest negatives about this address, and they are counted as such. The daemon stays
  // only because its existing connection to that same broker is open and serving, which is real
  // evidence that the broker is there and this process merely cannot open a NEW socket to it.
  //
  // The blackhole therefore runs INSIDE the hard backstop. Past the backstop this daemon SHOULD
  // exit even with a live transport. That is the bound, and cell D grades it.
