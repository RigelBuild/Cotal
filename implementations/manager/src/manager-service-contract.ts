/**
 * The manager's v0.4 SERVICE CONTRACT (control-surface P2 item 1): the §13.7 cluster document +
 * compiled command contracts that let the manager register as an ordinary `service` endpoint and
 * serve typed commands on the `ep.*` rails, dual-served beside its bespoke
 * `ctl.<tier>.<owner>.<actor>` control subjects until 1d deletes those.
 *
 * This module is PURE DATA + schema (no broker, no barrier, no wire I/O): the content-addressed
 * cluster document (the authority for every command's served shape) and the provenance-branded
 * `compileContract` pairs each `EpCommandDef` must carry. The registration/serve WIRING lives in
 * the manager (`registerManagerService`).
 *
 * REVISION 2 (slice 1b): the FULL op fan-out. Every served `ctl` op maps to a typed command; the
 * v0.3 op names map onto the Appendix-B caller vocabulary where one exists (`start` -> `spawn`;
 * the named `stop` -> `despawn` — on the v0.3 surface a named stop and a despawn are the same
 * terminal; the self no-name `stop` -> `stop` with authz-mode `self`; the per-agent `status`
 * read -> `inspect`, distinct from the 1a manager-level `status`). Targeting: `despawn`/`attach`
 * ride owner mode (the target block names the agent's principal + lifecycle uid; the fresh
 * resolver checks currency). `child` mode is DELIBERATELY NOT DECLARED anywhere — the panel's 1b
 * gate requires a DURABLE spawner record before child mode exists, so it fails closed by absence
 * until that record lands; own-child narrowing on despawn/attach meanwhile rides the SAME
 * `authorizeNamedControl` policy the ctl privileged tier runs (in-memory spawner, identical
 * source both doors). `ledger` mode is likewise absent (admin != ledger in static mode): every
 * admin-class command is untargeted + capability-gated — the broker grant (who holds the
 * request-publish row) stays the load-bearing tier boundary, exactly as the ctl cred layer is
 * today; the 1c migration table names who mints which capability.
 *
 * Capability labels (describe/grant vocabulary, one per tier class):
 *   manager.read     status / ps / inspect / models / list-personas / show-persona
 *   manager.spawn    spawn                                 (privileged-grade creation)
 *   manager.lifecycle despawn / attach / input             (owner-mode terminal/interactive)
 *   manager.self     stop                                  (self-mode halt; baseline)
 *   manager.persona  definePersona                         (privileged-grade; ownership-checked)
 *   manager.admin    purge / launch / resume family        (operator instruments only)
 *   manager.run      run-start / run-resume / run-answer   (the `run` capability + privileged instrument)
 *                    run-status / run-ps ride manager.read

 *  field and the feature was unreachable through this door (executed: the compiled input validator
 *  returned false for `{runId, name, spec}` while the CLI sends exactly that). ONE revision 6
 *  covered that whole branch: when the journal-action work lands, its `action` marker and
 *  `readinessDeadlineMs` declaration join revision 6 rather than minting one of their own.
 *
 *  7 = the `input` command (C3): typing into a running seat's terminal without holding a session.
 *  A NEW SERVED COMMAND is what a revision is for, and it cannot fold into 6: a caller's
 *  `describe` reads this document to learn what the responder serves, so a surface that grew

 *  longer the served one. (Revision 6's reservation is for fields on commands it ALREADY
 *  declares, which is the opposite case.)

 *  SERVED COMMAND is what a revision is for, and it cannot fold into 7: a caller's `describe`
 *  reads this document to learn what the responder serves.
 *
 *  9 = manager `status` records connector harness availability resolved at boot. A changed output
 *  contract is a changed described surface even though the command name is unchanged.
 *
 *  10 = the turn relay family (`turn`, `turn-pending`, `turn-yield`): a workflow run's one-turn
 *  goal against a seat, the seat's own pull of its pending turns, and its yield. NEW SERVED
 *  COMMANDS are what a revision is for, and three of them cannot fold into 9.
 *
 *  11 = `spawn` input grows `supervise` (`restarts` + `windowMs`): a declarative restart policy
 *  the manager enforces in place. A changed input contract is a changed described surface even
 *  though the command name is unchanged.
 *
 *  12 = the workflow-run family (`run-start`, `run-resume`, `run-answer`, `run-status`, `run-ps`,
 *  SPEC 14.3): the manager hosts a run's driver and serves its operator surface. NEW SERVED
 *  COMMANDS are what a revision is for, and five of them cannot fold into 11.
 *
 *  13 = manager `status` custody generation admits `custodied` (Linux pty seat ownership)
 *  alongside `legacy`. A changed output contract is a changed described surface even though
 *  the command name is unchanged.
 *
 *  14 = manager `status` adds static reconciliation state. Its output digest changed again, so
 *  cached revision-13 descriptions cannot name the new required output contract. This is a
 *  second, independent output change landing on the same command as 13, so it cannot fold into
 *  it: a caller holding a revision-13 descriptor would be told the surface it already knows.
 *
 *  15 = manager `status` adds `classSpawn`: whether this instance takes unpinned spawn/launch
 *  on the class rail. A changed output contract is a changed described surface even though
 *  the command name is unchanged.
 *
 *  16 = `run-answer` moves onto authz-mode `self`. The command input is unchanged; the caller's
 *  authenticated incarnation is now part of the request form so baseline seats can hold the row
 *  without gaining any untargeted run command.
 *
 *  17 = `resolve-cwd` lets a caller ask one manager instance to canonicalize an absolute existing
