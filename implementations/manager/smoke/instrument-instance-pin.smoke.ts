/**
 * INSTRUMENT INSTANCE PIN (#397) — `--on <instanceId>` reaches the MINT, so the one-shot operator
 * instrument is issued the exact instance rails for the invocation it was minted for.
 *
 * The defect was a parameter stopping one layer short. The client always routed an
 * instance-addressed request onto the `ep.inst` rail; every serve credential always subscribed it;
 * and the mint site already documented this exact case — `operatorInstrumentCapabilities` says the
 * non-scatter reads stay `one`-only "or `inst` when a resolve pins `--on`". That `inst` case could
 * not happen: the emitter builds an instance row only for a capability carrying an `instanceId`,
 * and nothing upstream ever passed one. `resolveControlTarget` took a profile and no instance, and
 * neither did the mint beneath it. The absence produced no error — just an unminted row, a refused
 * publish, and a client that renders that refusal as a describe timeout. Nothing to notice.
 *
 * The fix threads the instance the resolve already chose down into the mint. It is EXACT-ARITY: the
 * credential gets `ep.inst.<endpoint>.<thatInstance>.<command>` and no wildcard instance is minted
 * anywhere. That is what keeps `inst-route-grant`'s denied arm intact, and CELL 1 below asserts it
 * rather than assuming it — a wildcard row would satisfy every live check in this file while
 * quietly destroying the boundary, so the boundary is checked directly.
 *
 * COVERAGE BOUNDARY, stated so this is not over-read. Cells 1-4 build their own inputs: they call
 * `instancePinnedInstrumentCapabilities` and mint directly. So they prove the GRANT SHAPING and the
 * live rails end to end — a pinned instrument reaches the instance it names, an unpinned one still
 * cannot, and no ordinary credential gains a route. They do NOT prove the CLI threads `--on` down
 * to the mint: `agents.ts`/`spawn.ts` -> `resolveControlTarget` -> `connectOrExit` type-checks with
 * the argument dropped anywhere along it. That gap is no longer merely named; it is covered by
 * `cli-on-instance-live.smoke.ts`, which drives the real binary; and it was a real shipped defect,
 * not a hypothetical. Keep the two suites distinct: "the pin works" and "the flag reaches the pin"
 * are different claims, evidenced in different files.
 *
 * Cells 5 and 6 grade the describe's permission watch and the split-retry guard, and both reach
 * into internals on purpose (the transport's status-listener registry; `Endpoint`'s resolved-service
 * cache). Neither has a public accessor, and both guard regressions that every functional assertion
 * in this file would miss: a leaked listener per resolve, and a mutating command re-issued after a
 * responder already answered it (a second attempt that may duplicate its effect).
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:instrument-instance-pin

      // subset of commands can satisfy it.
      //
      // The assertion is the PUBLISH COUNT, not the throw, and that choice is load-bearing. A
      // second invoke can split again and throw the identical error, so "it threw" does not separate
      // "the guard held" from "the retry ran and failed too", roughly a coin flip each time, which
      // would make this cell flaky rather than wrong. The publish count is deterministic: one
      // publish means nothing was re-issued; a retry adds a describe and a second invoke. (An
      // earlier version used the cache as this witness; the guard now DROPS the stale bind on
      // purpose, so the cache can no longer tell "held" from "retried", and the count is the direct
      // measurement anyway.)
      // AND THE SWEEP MUST PROVE IT RAN. The first version of this loop asserted only its witness,
      // and it passed with the guard replaced by a hardcoded `command === "spawn" || command ===
      // "purge"`: SURVIVED at 37/37, the full baseline, twice. The reason is the failure mode this
      // file is otherwise careful about: a command that never reaches a responder re-issues nothing
      // either, so the witness was satisfied by commands that had proved nothing. A vacuous pass
      // and a real pass looked identical.
      //
      // So each iteration must first establish that it actually reached the guard, and only then is
      // the witness meaningful. `notReached` is not a tolerance: it is red, because a command that
      // cannot get there is a hole in the sweep and must be seen rather than absorbed.
      //
      // WHAT THE MARKER PROVES, EXACTLY (narrower than an earlier draft of this comment claimed),
      // which said the responder "received and handled it". It proves the published request drew an
      // ATTRIBUTED REPLY from a responder, which is precisely the guard's own input and therefore
      // exactly the right witness here. It does NOT prove the command executed or that any effect
      // landed: an attributed reply can come from validation, authorization, admission, or a
      // business refusal, and the schema-valid nonsense arguments below deliberately provoke the
      // last of those. So this sweep grades the classifier-to-guard wiring across the vocabulary and
      // nothing more. The `purge` cell above is the separate proof that a real destructive effect
      // runs, and it is the only cell in this file that claims one.
      // Each command needs SCHEMA-VALID arguments or the envelope refuses it before it is ever
      // published, which is precisely how the first version passed vacuously: `{}` fails
      // `required` on all seven, so none of them left the client. The values are deliberately
      // nonsense (no such run, no such attempt) so every handler refuses on business grounds and
      // nothing is launched, resumed, or preserved; refusing is a REPLY, which is all this needs.
      // If a schema gains a required field, `notReached` goes red rather than the cell going quiet.
