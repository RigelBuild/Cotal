/**
 * `cotal run` — the workflow-run operator surface.
 *
 * Five verbs: `start` drives a new run, `resume` takes an existing run over, `ps` lists the run
 * records of an endpoint, `journal` prints a run's durable step journal, and `answer` resolves an
 * open checkpoint, or an open `ask` attempt, through the run driver, which is the only door an
 * answer has (§14).
 *
 * By default every verb is a CLIENT of the mesh's manager (SPEC 14.3): the manager hosts the
 * driver on its own per-run credential, so `start` and `resume` return the run id at once and the
 * run keeps going after this terminal closes, survives a manager restart, and is answered from
 * anywhere. `--local` keeps the older composition, in this process: one raw connection, the mesh
 * handler bound to this process as holder, the drive held until it settles. It is for a bare broker
 * with no manager, for a program a manager cannot host (one recorded before programs were recorded),
 * and for the driver's own tests. Checkpoint EXPIRY rides the mediated timer writer, which the
 * delivery daemon pumps on a live mesh; a local `start` on a bare broker still runs and still
 * resolves, it just cannot expire a pause.

 * What a hosted `run` verb prints when its manager describe drew no answer, SCOPED TO THE RAIL the

 *
 * On the LEGACY `ep` rail there is one rail and nothing answered on it, so "is a manager running?"
 * is the right question and `--local` is the right remedy.
 *
 * On the VERSIONED (issued) rail it is not. SPEC 13.15 keeps the two rails disjoint at the broker
 * and requires an endpoint to serve both, so a manager older than the versioned rail subscribes
 * `ep` alone: it is running, it is on the roster, and this caller cannot reach it. #1630 measured
 * both halves of the damage. The question ASSERTS one of two causes, and `--local` is the remedy
 * that follows from it: it drives the run from this process and NAMES THE CALLER as its answerer,
 * so an operator who takes the tool's advice on a mesh whose manager is merely old submits an
 * answer under the wrong identity.
 *
 * So the versioned wording names BOTH causes and asserts neither, because this side cannot tell
 * them apart: the service registry records no package version. Naming only the skew is the same
 * defect one step over, and it is reachable - `bin/smoke/control-transport-dial.smoke.ts` runs a
 * fixture with no manager at all, and an operator there would have been sent to check a version.
