/**
 * Console render smoke (no NATS, no test runner): pnpm --filter @cotal-ai/cli test
 *
 * The console's models were well covered and its RENDER SITES were not, which is a gap the models'
 * own greens hide: `sparkline()` and `membershipFreshness()` can be perfect while the component
 * that was supposed to draw them no longer calls them, and every existing cell stays green because
 * every existing cell imports the helper rather than the component. Deleting the `<Sparkline/>`
 * from the status bar, or the membership pill from the topology header, was measured to leave the
 * whole suite green.
 *
 * So these cells mount the REAL components. Ink renders into a supplied stream rather than a TTY,
 * which needs no test-only dependency on a published package: `ink` is already the CLI's own.
 * What is asserted is what an operator would see on the screen.
